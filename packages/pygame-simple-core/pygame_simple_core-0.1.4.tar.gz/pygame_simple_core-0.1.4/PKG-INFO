# Pygame Simple Core

A Python library for building Pygame applications with reusable components and utilities.

## Installation

You can install this library using pip. Run the following command:

```bash
pip install pygame_simple_core
```

## Usage

You can start by extending the Core class and overriding your interface methods

```python
from pygame_simple_core import Core


class Game(Core):

    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super().__init__()

    def check_event(self, event):
        pass

    def update(self):
        pass

    def draw(self):
        pass

    def quit(self):
        pass

```

1. **check_event:** called for every pygame event except for *pg.QUIT* that is handled by the core.
2. **update:** called every frame, can be used to handle your game logic.
3. **draw:** called every frame, can be used to draw your game elements.
4. **quit:** called when *pg.QUIT* or a key that is in *quit_keys* is pressed, after this the program will quit, to prevent this you can reset *running* to True.

To run this code only instanciate your class and call the run methods provided by core:

```python
game = Game()
game.run()
```
