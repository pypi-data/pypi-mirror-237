    The use of this class is optional. The code must not rely on inheritance from this class, but only on the
    presence of its methods. These methods may be implemented without using any specific base or mixin class.

    Final record classes stored in a data source must implement the following methods and properties.
    They may be provided by mixins and intermediate base classes using dataclass and similar frameworks.

    - context: Field or property with type Context that has both getter and setter.
    - get_common_base: Static method returning the type of the common base for all classes
      stored in the same table as this class.
    - get_key: Return primary key of this instance in semicolon-delimited string format.
      For example, key=`A;B` for a class with two primary key fields that have values `A` and `B`.
    - to_dict(self) - instance method serializing self as dictionary.
    - from_dict(self, data_dict) - instance method populating self from dictionary.

    Context provides platform-independent APIs for:

    - Databases and distributed cache
    - Logging and error reporting
    - Local or remote handler execution
    - Progress reporting

        Notes:

        For composite keys, the embedded keys are concatenated in the
        order of their declaration without brackets.

        Examples:

            - One primary key field A: `A`
            - Two primary key fields A and B: `A;B`
            - Two primary key fields `A1;A2` and `B`: `A1;A2;B`

        Notes:
