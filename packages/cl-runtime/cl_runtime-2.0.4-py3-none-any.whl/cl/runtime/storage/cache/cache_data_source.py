        Load instances of classes derived from base_type from storage using a sequence of keys.

        - Parameter `base_type` determines the database table where the search is performed.
        - Error message if a loaded record is not derived from `base_type`.
        - The order of results is the same as the order of argument keys unless `is_unordered` is set.
        - To avoid saving and then loading the records that are created in memory, any argument key that
          is itself derived from base_type will be returned bypassing the data source query.
          Call `get_key()` on keys before passing them as argument to avoid this behavior.

            base_type: Loaded records must be derived from `base_type`

            data_set: Directory-like attribute used to organize the data.

            is_optional_key: Return None if a key is None. Default is to raise an error.
