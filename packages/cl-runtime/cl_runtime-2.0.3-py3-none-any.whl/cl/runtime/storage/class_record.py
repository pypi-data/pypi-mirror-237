    """
    Base class for polymorphic records where all serializable
    data is stored in dataclass fields.

    The recommended inheritance chain includes two classes:

    ClassRecord > SampleRecordKey > SampleRecord > DerivedRecord

    * SampleRecordKey contains primary key attributes. It can be used
      as a foreign key attribute in other data classes, providing
      static (code inspection-based) type safety.
    * SampleRecord is derived from SampleRecordKey and contains all
      attributes except those included in SampleRecordKey class.

    If a separate key class is not required, a simpler inheritance
    chain can be used:

    ClassRecord > SampleRecord > DerivedRecord

    With this simpler inheritance chain, foreign key can be stored in
    other data types with runtime type safety as the string generated
    by get_key() method.
