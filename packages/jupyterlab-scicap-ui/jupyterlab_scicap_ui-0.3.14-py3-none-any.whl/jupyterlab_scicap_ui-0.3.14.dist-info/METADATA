# jupyterlab-scicap-ui

This package is a jupyterlab extension for the Science Capsule user interface.
It loads the [scicap-ui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@codytodonnell/scicap-ui) React app into a widget that can be launched from the jupyterlab launcher window.

## Install

```bash
jlpm
jlpm build
jupyter labextension install .

# Rebuild Typescript source after making changes
jlpm build
# Rebuild JupyterLab after making any changes
jupyter lab build
```

You can watch the source directory and run JupyterLab in watch mode to watch for changes in the extension's source and automatically rebuild the extension and application.

```bash
# Watch the source directory in another terminal tab
jlpm watch
# Run jupyterlab in watch mode in one terminal tab
jupyter lab --watch
```

## Build and Publish

First commit changes and upgrade the package version using npm.

```
npm version patch
```

Then build the labextension and python distribution.

```
jlpm run build:dist
```

Then publish the `.whl` file to pypi.

```
jlpm run publish
```

In order to publish, you will have to authenticate with pypi and your account must have permission to administer the [jupyterlab-scicap-ui package](https://pypi.org/project/jupyterlab-scicap-ui/) on pypi.
