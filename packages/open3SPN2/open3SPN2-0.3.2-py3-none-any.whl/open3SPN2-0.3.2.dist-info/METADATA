# Open-3SPN2
A Implementation of the 3SPN.2 and 3SPN.2C coarse-grained molecular model of DNA in OpenMM.

3SPN.2 and 3SPN.2C are DNA coarse-grained forcefields developed by the [de Pablo group](https://pme.uchicago.edu/group/de-pablo-group). Each DNA nucleotide is modelled by 3 beads: one bead for the phosphate, a second one for the sugar and a third one nucleobase. These forcefields were adapted by the [Wolynes group](https://wolynes.rice.edu/) to model protein-DNA interactions as a complement for the [AWSEM](https://github.com/npschafer/openawsem) coarse-grained protein forcefield.

## Installation

Installation of the open3SPN2 repository is available through anaconda. Some of the dependencies  are contained in the omnia channel (openmm, pdbfixer) or in the conda-forge channel (mdtraj).

```conda config --append channels conda-forge```

```conda install -c wolynes-lab open3spn2```

For protein-DNA simulations you will also need to install [openAWSEM](https://github.com/npschafer/openawsem) and add the openAWSEM path to the `$PYTHONPATH` environment variable. In linux you can set the path variables on `~/.bashrc`.

```export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/openAWSEM:$PYTHONPATH```
