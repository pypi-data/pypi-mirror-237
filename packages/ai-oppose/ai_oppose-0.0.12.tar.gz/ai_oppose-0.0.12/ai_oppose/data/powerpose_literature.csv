A Bayesian Model-Averaged Meta-Analysis of the Power Pose Effect with Informed and Default Priors: The Case of Felt Power,"Quentin Frederik Gronau, Sara van Erp, Daniel W. Heck, Joseph Cesario, Kai Jonas, Eric-Jan Wagenmakers",2017,"Carney, Cuddy, and Yap (2010) found that --compared to participants who adopted constrictive body postures-- participants who adopted expansive body postures reported feeling more powerful, showed an increase in testosterone and a decrease in cortisol, and displayed anincreased tolerance for risk. However, these power pose effects have recently come under considerable scrutiny. Here we present a Bayesian meta-analysis of six preregistered studies from this special issue, focusing on the effect of power posing on felt power. Our analysisimproves on standard classical meta-analyses in several ways. First and foremost, we considered only preregistered studies, eliminating concerns about publication bias. Second, the Bayesian approach enables us to quantify evidence for both the alternative and the null hypothesis. Third, we use Bayesian model-averaging to account for the uncertainty with respect to the choice for a fixed-effect model or a random-effect model. Fourth, based on a literature review we obtained an empirically informed prior distribution for the between-studyheterogeneity of effect sizes. This empirically informed prior can serve as a default choice not only for the investigation of the power pose effect, but for effects in the field of psychology more generally. For effect size, we considered a default and an informed prior. Our meta-analysis yields very strong evidence for an effect of power posing on felt power. However, when the analysis is restricted to participants unfamiliar with the effect, the meta-analysis yields evidence that is only moderate."
A Meta-Analysis of the Facial Feedback Literature: Effects of Facial Expressions on Emotional Experience are Small and Variable,Nicholas A. Coles,2018,"The facial feedback hypothesis suggests that our facial expressions influence our emotional experience. In light of Wagenmakers et al.â€™s (2016) failure to replicate Strack, Martin, and Stepperâ€™s (1988) seminal demonstration of facial feedback effects, a meta-analysis was conducted on 286 effect sizes derived from 136 facial feedback studies. Results revealed that the overall effect of facial feedback on affective experience was significant, but small (d = .20, p < .000000005). Approximately 70% of variation in facial feedback effect sizes is due to heterogeneity, which suggests that facial feedback effects are stronger in some circumstances than others. Eleven potential moderators were examined, and three were associated with differences in effect sizes: (1) Type of affective reaction: Facial feedback influenced emotional experience (e.g., reported amusement) and, to an even greater degree, perceptions of stimuliâ€™s affective quality (e.g., funniness of cartoons). However, after controlling for publication bias, there was little evidence that facial feedback influenced perceptions of affective quality. (2) Presence of emotional stimuli: Facial feedback effects on emotional experience were larger in the absence of emotionally evocative stimuli (e.g., cartoons). (3) Type of stimuli: When participants are presented with emotionally evocative stimuli, facial feedback effects were larger in the presence of some types of stimuli (e.g., imagined scenarios) than others (e.g., pictures)."
A randomized controlled study of power posing before public speaking exposure for social anxiety disorder: No evidence for augmentative effects.,"Michelle L. Davis, Santiago Papini, David Rosenfield, Karin Roelofs, Sarah Kolb, Mark B. Powers, Jasper A. J. Smits",2017,"This manuscript details a randomized controlled study designed to test the efficacy of power posing (i.e., briefly holding postures associated with dominance and power) as an augmentative strategy for exposure therapy for social anxiety disorder (SAD). Seventy-three individuals diagnosed with SAD were assigned to one of three conditions: power posing, submissive posing, or rest (no posing) prior to participating in an exposure therapy session. Participants were assessed for between-group differences in pre- and post-manipulation salivary hormone levels, within-session subjective experiences of fear, and pre- and 1-week post-treatment SAD severity outcome measures. Though the intervention resulted in decreased SAD symptom severity one week later, analyses revealed no significant between-group differences on any tested variables. Accordingly, this study provides no evidence to suggest that power posing impacts hormone levels or exposure therapy outcomes."
Assessing the Robustness of Power Posing,"Eva Ranehill, Anna Dreber, M. Johannesson, Susanne Leiberg, Sunhae Sul, Roberto A. Weber",2015,"In a growing body of research, psychologists have studied how physical expression influences psychological processes (see Riskind & Gotay, 1982; Stepper & Strack, 1993, for early contributions to this literature). A recent strand of literature within this field has focused on how physical postures that express power and dominance (power poses) influence psychological and physiological processes, as well as decision making (e.g., Carney, Cuddy, & Yap, 2010; Cesario & McDonald, 2013; Yap, Wazlawek, Lucas, Cuddy, & Carney, 2013). Carney et al. found that power posing affected levels of hormones such as testosterone and cortisol, financial risk taking, and self-reported feelings of power in a sample of 42 participants (randomly assigned to hold poses suggesting either high or low power). We conducted a conceptual replication study with a similar methodology as that employed by Carney et al. but using a substantially larger sample (N = 200) and a design in which the experimenter was blind to condition. Our statistical power to detect an effect of the magnitude reported by Carney et al. was more than 95% (see the Supplemental Material available online). In addition to the three outcome measures that Carney et al. used, we also studied two more behavioral tasks (risk taking in the loss domain and willingness to compete). Consistent with the findings of Carney et al., our results showed a significant effect of power posing on self-reported feelings of power. However, we found no significant effect of power posing on hormonal levels or in any of the three behavioral tasks."
"Behavioral Priming: It's All in the Mind, but Whose Mind?","S. Doyen, O. Klein, Cora-Lise Pichon, Axel Cleeremans",2012,"The perspective that behavior is often driven by unconscious determinants has become widespread in social psychology. Bargh, Chen, and Burrows' (1996) famous study, in which participants unwittingly exposed to the stereotype of age walked slower when exiting the laboratory, was instrumental in defining this perspective. Here, we present two experiments aimed at replicating the original study. Despite the use of automated timing methods and a larger sample, our first experiment failed to show priming. Our second experiment was aimed at manipulating the beliefs of the experimenters: Half were led to think that participants would walk slower when primed congruently, and the other half was led to expect the opposite. Strikingly, we obtained a walking speed effect, but only when experimenters believed participants would indeed walk slower. This suggests that both priming and experimenters' expectations are instrumental in explaining the walking speed effect. Further, debriefing was suggestive of awareness of the primes. We conclude that unconscious behavioral priming is real, while real, involves mechanisms different from those typically assumed to cause the effect."
Benefits of power posing: effects on dominance and social sensitivity,"Lukas Klaschinski, Konrad Schnabel, M. SchrÃ¶derâ€“AbÃ©",2017,"The current study attempted to replicate results by Cuddy, Wilmuth, Yap, and Carney (2015) who showed that adopting high-power poses prior to a demanding job interview improved dominant behavior and overall hireability judgments. We extended this approach by adding social sensitivity as a second important dimension of social competences. We tested the following hypotheses: (1) Power posing increases behavioral dominance indicators (2) Power posing strengthens behavioral indicators of social sensitivity. We also attempted to replicate results by Cuddy and colleagues who demonstrated that the effects of the power-posing manipulation on hireability judgments were mediated by behavioral dominance indicators. Additionally, we hypothesized that hireability judgments are independently predicted by indicators of dominance and social sensitivity. Results failed to replicate the findings by Cuddy and colleagues (2015). Power posing had no significant main effects on behavioral indicators of dominance and social sensitivity. As expected, hireability judgments were independently predicted by dominance and social sensitivity."
BODIES IN CONTEXT: POWER POSES AS A COMPUTATION OF ACTION POSSIBILITY,"Joseph Cesario, Melissa M. McDonald",2013,"One perspective on embodiment proposes that bodily states exert direct, context-free effects on psychological states, as in the research on â€œpower poses.â€ We propose instead that bodily states influence psychology by providing information about what actions are possible. If such an assessment is to be effective, however, it must consider the body as it exists in context, as context provides essential information in defining action possibility. In Study 1, expansive and constrictive poses influenced power only when held in an interpersonal context, which provides action-relevant meaning to these poses as dominance and submissiveness. In Study 2, poses had no effect on power when roles provided more important information about potential action (e.g., being frisked by police while holding an expansive pose resulted in less powerful behavior). If the function of cognition is to prepare the body for effective action, then cognitive processes cannot be insensitive to the current context."
Bodily feedback: expansive and upward posture facilitates the experience of positive affect,"Patty Van Cappellen, K. Ladd, Stephanie Cassidy, M. Edwards, B. Fredrickson",2022,"ABSTRACT Most emotion theories recognise the importance of the body in expressing and constructing emotions. Focusing beyond the face, the present research adds needed empirical data on the effect of static full body postures on positive/negative affect. In Studies 1 (Nâ€‰=â€‰110) and 2 (Nâ€‰=â€‰79), using a bodily feedback paradigm, we manipulated postures to test causal effects on affective and physiological responses to emotionally ambiguous music. Across both studies among U.S. participants, we find the strongest support for an effect of bodily postures that are expansive and oriented upward on positive affect. In addition, an expansive and upward pose also led to greater cardiac vagal reactivity but these changes in parasympathetic activity were not related to affective changes (Study 2). In line with embodied theories, these results provide additional support for the role of postural input in constructing affect. Discussion highlights the relevance of these findings for the study of religious practices during which the postures studied are often adopted."
Body of guilt: Using embodied cognition to mitigate backlash to reminders of personal & ingroup wrongdoingâ˜†,"Katie N. Rotella, Jennifer A. Richeson",2013,"Abstract   Research demonstrates that people are sensitive to information that portrays either themselves or their ingroups in a negative light. Indeed, confronting individuals with their own past misdeeds or those committed by important ingroups can result in victim-blaming and refusals to apologize or make amends. Studies suggest that one reason why people demonstrate these backlash effects is that they immediately blunt the experience of guilt when confronted with either their own or group misdeeds from the past. The more individuals actually experience guilt, however, the more likely they are to respond to information about past wrongdoing with prosocial behavior (e.g., apologies, reparations, etc.). The present research sought to examine how subtle inductions of guilt shape responses to personal and group wrongdoing; namely, by manipulating individuals' body postures. Consistent with predictions, results suggest that embodiment-induced guilt reduces negative backlash and increases prosocial interpersonal and intergroup intentions."
Body Posture and Religious Attitudes,"Robert C. Fuller, Derek E. Montgomery",2015,"One hundred and twenty-seven college students were recruited for an experimental investigation of the effect of body posture on religious attitudes. Roughly half of the participants were placed in lower, contractive body postures while the other half were placed in higher, expansive body postures. After five minutes in these postures, all were asked to fill out a measure of religious attitudes. As expected, participants in the lower, contractive positions expressed more agreement with conventional religious beliefs than those in the higher, expansive positions."
Body posture effects on self-evaluation: A self-validation approach,"P. BriÃ±ol, R. Petty, B. Wagner",2009,"Building on the notion of embodied attitudes, we examined how body postures can influence self-evaluations by affecting thought confidence, a meta-cognitive process. Specifically, participants were asked to think about and write down their best or worse qualities while they were sitting down with their backerect and pushing theirchest out (confident posture) or slouched forward with their back curved (doubtful posture). Then, participants completed a number of measures and reported their self-evaluations. In line with the self-validation hypothesis, we predicted and found that the effect of the direction of thoughts (positive/negative) on self-related attitudes was significantly greater when participants wrote their thoughts in the confident than in the doubtful posture. These postures did not influence the number or quality of thoughts listed, but did have an impact on the confidence with which people held their thoughts. Copyright # 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
Could a woman be superman? Gender and the embodiment of power postures,"April H. Bailey, M. LaFrance, J. Dovidio",2017,"Physical postures can instill a sense of power in the self as well as communicate power to others. Recent work indicates that a target’s gender interferes with the rapid identification of power postures; men in low-power postures and women in high-power postures slow viewers’ identification. We hypothesized that how long people enact low and high-power postures will vary as a function of their own gender and the gender of the person modeling the posture. We presented male and female participants with images of male and female models in low and high-power postures and asked them to enact the postures for an unspecific duration. We measured enacted duration, risky behavior, and felt power. The preregistered hypothesis that posture condition and participant gender would interact was not supported. Instead, overall, participants enacted the high-power postures longer than the low-power posture. Supporting the preregistered hypothesis that target gender would interact with posture condition and participant gender, only male participants’ time in the postures was sensitive to posture and model gender combinations. Consistent with theories proposing greater rigidity of male gender roles, male participants enacted the low-power postures for the least amount of time when duplicating a female model in a low-power posture. Finally, we did not strongly replicate prior work, but found some support that enacting high-power postures led to riskier behavior and more felt power for some aspects of the sample in exploratory analyses."
CRSP special issue on power poses: what was the point and what did we learn?,"Joseph Cesario, Kai J. Jonas, Dana R. Carney",2017,"The possibility that holding an expansive nonverbal display for two minutes could affect a person’s behavioral, psychological, and physiological states was a provocative idea when first proposed (Carney, Cuddy, & Yap, Citation2010). Specifically, the notion that a static nonverbal expression could affect a person’s endocrine profile – namely their cortisol and testosterone levels – was so provocative it was almost preposterous. However, the field of social psychology took notice. Additional claims were then made about how such poses might positively impact a person’s life, particularly for people “with no resources and no technology and no status and no power” (Cuddy, Citation2012).

This exciting proposition ignited a wave of popular interest, evidenced in one way by the enormous popularity of a TED talk about the idea that has, at the end of 2016, already been viewed 38 million times. Beyond this specific finding, Carney et al. (Citation2010) hoped to offer an important theoretical contribution to theories of mind–body interaction such as the James–Lange theory of emotion (James, Citation1884; Lange, Citation1912) and Jamesian notions of ideomotor action (for a review, see Laird & Lacasse, Citation2014). This work hoped to offer support for a bidirectional link between a nonverbal display of a powerful-looking posture and the mental and physiological states that were indicative of possessing power.

This idea was, to put it mildly, subject to the hard glare of scientific inquiry not long after its debut. Approximately 5 years after the original paper was published, a conspicuous failure to replicate (Ranehill et al., Citation2015) caught the attention of many who were already skeptical – including Carney herself. A response (Carney, Cuddy, & Yap, Citation2015) to Ranehill et al. dutifully listed the many differences between the original 2010 paper and the 2015 failure to replicate that might have served as possible moderators. Further variations on the original power pose work were published, many by the original research team members – albeit based on data collected before the Ranehill publication – including work demonstrating that power posing could positively impact job interview performance (Cuddy, Wilmuth, Yap, & Carney, Citation2015).

At the same time, among some circles the idea became a shorthand for flashy social psychological work that could not be replicated (see, e.g., Andrew Gelman’s blog posts on the topic and additional failures to replicate such as Garrison, Tang, & Schmeichel, Citation2016). Further, it became increasingly clear to some authors of “power pose” work that effects were fragile at best, and likely not replicable as researchers across the world wanted to discuss minor differences between the original study and theirs – because their work did not replicate the original (Carney, Citation2016). Much of this work was never published. Perhaps the authors of the failed replications did not wish to throw fuel on the fire, but the fire was already burning when a p-curve analysis of the reply to Ranehill written by Carney et al. (Citation2015) suggested strongly that even though some papers showed effects, overall the body of work had no evidentiary value (Simmons & Simonsohn, Citation2015).

In this context, one purpose of this Special Issue by CRSP was to gather additional data – but this time transparent and preregistered – about the effects of power poses, including direct replications and tests of possible moderators. Our aim in this regard was to demonstrate the possibility of a different path than the unproductive cycle that social psychology has come to know all too well in recent years: a provocative finding with a small sample size, a failure to replicate, a rebuttal outlining all the possible reasons (some would say excuses) for the failure, researchers entrenching in their views and refusing to update based on new data, and so on. Part of our aim, then, was to show how researchers could coordinate and cooperate in an effective and efficient manner.

We admit that we were expecting this special issue to be a “final word” on the topic, providing a consistent and definitive answer on both the replication and novel effects. As the results rolled in, we initially believed that we were on exactly this path, as the preregistered predictions failed to show strong evidence of effects. We further expected that the issue-wide analysis, overseen by E.J. Wagenmakers, would confirm these expectations. However, a surprise awaited us as the novel Bayesian meta-analysis conducted by Gronau (Gronau et al., this issue) in fact showed a reliable non-zero effect on felt power, despite the majority of individual studies failing to reject the null hypothesis. (Unfortunately, the measure of felt power was the only measure included in enough papers to provide such a test, meaning that on the behavioral indicators we are left with the analyses from each individual study only.)

While this special issue did not provide the kind of definitive final word which we hoped for, we believe something much more interesting has emerged. This coordinated research effort has now outlined a clear program of research for anyone who wishes to take power poses seriously. Given the failures to find effects on actual power-related behaviors, and only a small effect on felt power, then the following questions must be answered for power poses to continue to be recommended: (1) is the self-reported measure of felt power anything beyond an experimental demand characteristic? and (2) are there conditions under which feeling powerful from power poses could lead to beneficial behavioral changes? (It seems unlikely to us that the latter question will be answered in the affirmative because if increases in self-reported power did lead to changes in behavior, such behavioral effects would likely have been observed in at least some of the articles published in this special issue.) One positive report of this special issue, then, is that there may be some value of power poses on self-reported sense of power, but whether this effect is a methodological artifact or is meaningful is an open question and this issue of CRSP has charted out a clear path toward future research for those interested in the topic.

At the same time, there was a more important goal for this Special Issue beyond merely providing additional data on a narrow research question. The broader goal was to demonstrate the benefits of peer-reviewed preregistration for enhancing the quality of research. The benefit of preregistration is clear. (And in other outlets we have described the benefits of peer-reviewed preregistration; see Jonas & Cesario, Citation2015.) While previous, non-preregistered replication projects often faced discussions about the validity of the obtained results, the approach taken, or the analyses applied, a preregistered and peer-reviewed route is fully transparent and also benefits from the input of reviewers. To this end, it is instructive to ask, how was any individual research proposal meaningfully changed by this process?

Without exception, the method, design, or analysis of every proposed study was modified in some way following the initial Stage 1 review. True experts in the fields of embodied cognition, hormones, and other relevant areas of expertise provided advice to researchers before they spent precious resources conducting these studies. It is certainly the case that the quality of the research was improved by the preregistration process, a point confirmed by the many emails and positive comments we received by the authors during and after the review process. Indeed, the authors’ comments reveal something we have long argued: That the peer-review preregistration process changes the dynamic and tone of the review process from destructive and negative to constructive and exciting. Reviewers were not on the lookout for the many ways the researchers failed to do what they should have (often a reflection of reviewers trying to show how smart they are) but instead approached these proposals with the mindset of, “What would I do to make this the best research possible?” Refreshing indeed.

Most important, every researcher received feedback from a true expert in power poses – Dana Carney, first author on the original power pose manuscript (Carney et al., Citation2010). Carney reviewed all proposals with replication plans (direct or conceptual) and provided detailed feedback, including experimenter scripts, programmed experiments, stimuli, instructions on how to get the participants to hold the poses exactly, and nuanced and highly specific information not obvious from or included in the original publication. Researchers often bemoan learning such “insider information” only after the fact or not at all. The peer-review preregistration process at CRSP solves this problem and, as indicated from the comments of the researchers, is a much-appreciated change.Footnote1

A final benefit of the preregistration process at CRSP is the ability to coordinate among researchers prior to any researcher beginning data collection. This allowed us to make two contributions with this special issue that would not otherwise have been possible. First, we were able to ensure that multiple researchers had the basic conditions present in their studies – comparing expansive and contractive poses – which allowed us to provide an overall, cross-lab analysis testing replication of the basic power pose effect (Gronau et al., this issue). Moreover, we were able to have all researchers include a measure of whether participants had seen the TED talk on power poses, which allowed for cross-lab testing of a key potential moderator of power pose effects. This analysis, testing whether awareness influences the effect of expansive poses, appears as the final paper in this special issue and supports the possibility that the observed effect of powerful poses on felt power might be understood as a demand characteristic, as the effect was weaker with those participants unfamiliar with the TED talk (Gronau et al., Citationin press).

As a final note, it is important to state that all three of us have, at one point or other, supported the possibility that power poses could have meaningful effects on behavior, psychology, physiology, or cognition (e.g. Carney et al., Citation2010; Cesario & McDonald, Citation2013). It is also important to note that the research presented here did not include any tests of whether power poses could impact others, as an expression of nonverbal behavior (for a review, see Hogue & Lord, Citation2007; and specifically for power poses, Rennung, Blum, & Göritz, Citation2016). This distinction is important because there is a long history of research in communication studies, anthropology, primatology, and social psychology on the way in which power and status are displayed to others in social context. This vast body of work on nonverbal displays is not to be confused with the power pose work and the focus of this special issue which was on embodied effects of these postures.
Moreover, it is obvious that the researchers contributing to this special issue framed their research as a productive and generative enterprise, not one designed to destroy or undermine past research. We are compelled to make this point given the tendency for researchers to react to failed replications by maligning the intentions or integrity of those researchers who fail to support past research, as though the desires of the researchers are fully responsible for the outcome of the research. (Curiously, the desires of researchers to find effects never play a role in these defensive arguments.) The very costly expense (in terms of time, money, and effort) required to chip away at published effects, needed to attain a “critical mass” of evidence given current publishing and statistical standards, is a highly inefficient use of resources in psychological science. Of course, science is to advance incrementally, but it should do so efficiently if possible. One cannot help but wonder whether the field would look different today had peer-reviewed preregistration been widely implemented a decade ago."
Do Better in Math: How Your Body Posture May Change Stereotype Threat Response,"E. Peper, R. Harvey, Lauren A. Mason, I. Lin",2018,"This study investigates posture on mental math performance.Â  125 students (M = 23.5 years) participated as part of a class activity. Half the students sat in an erect position while the other half sat in a slouched position and were asked to mentally subtract 7 serially from 964 for 30 seconds. They then reversed the positions before repeating the math subtraction task beginning at 834. They rated the math task difficulty on a scale from 0 (none) to 10 (extreme). The math test was rated significantly more difficult while sitting slouched (M = 6.2) than while sitting erect (M = 4.9) ANOVA [ F (1,243) = 17.06, p < 0.001]. Participants with the highest test anxiety, math difficulty and blanking out scores (TAMDBOS) rated the math task significantly more difficult in the slouched position (M = 7.0) as compared to the erect position (M = 4.8) ANOVA [ F (1,75) = 17.85, p < 0.001]. Tor the participants with the lowest 30% TAMDBOS, there was no significant difference between slouched (M=4.90) and erect positions (M = 4.0).Â  The participants with the highest TAMDBOS experienced significantly more somatic symptoms as compared with the lowest TAMDBOS. Discussed are processes such as stereotypic threat associated with a â€˜defense reactionâ€™ by which posture can affect mental math and inhibit abstract thinking. Moreover, clinicians who work with students who have learning difficulty may improve outcome if they include posture changes."
Does that pose become you? Testing the Effect of Body Postures on Self-Concept,"B. Jackson, Kelly A. Nault, L. Richman, Onawa P. LaBelle, N. Rohleder",2017,"Self-concept expansion predicts a range of adaptive outcomes. An intriguing possible cause of self-concept expansion is the posing of one’s body expansively, that is, “power posing.” In Study 1 (N = 65), we found that body expansion had an effect, of moderate magnitude (d = 0.58), on self-concept size in college women as measured by the Twenty Statements Test. Participants who were randomly assigned to hold expanded poses (vs. contracted) – under the guise of a cover story about holding different body positions to test the accuracy of wireless electrodes – wrote significantly more self-statements than those who assumed contracted positions. In pre-registered Study 2 we tested whether this finding was replicable and extended this research by aiming to characterize the process by which it occurred. One hundred and twenty-eight women students were randomly assigned to hold either expanded or contracted postures. They completed surveys measuring two general classes of potential mediators (“broaden-and-build” and “narrow-and-disrupt”), body self-objectification as a moderator, and four indices of self-concept size. Posture was not found to affect self-concept size, nor was it moderated by self-objectification. Though there was no effect on self-expansion, in exploratory analyses, assigned posture affected one of the broaden-and-build measures: psychological flexibility. Results of Study 2 could indicate that a mere two minutes of holding an expanded versus contracted body posture is not enough to induce changes in self-concept size; lack of main effects could in addition be due to a range of unmeasured confounders and/or the fragile and transient nature of the effect."
Do expansive or contractive body postures affect feelings of self-worth? High power poses impact state self-esteem,"Robert KÃ¶rner, Lars-Eric Petersen, Astrid SchÃ¼tz",2021,"The aim of the present studies was to investigate how high and low power posing influence self-esteem. High power posing is understood as the nonverbal expression of power through open, expansive body postures, whereas low power posing is marked by contractive and closed body postures. We conducted three studies with different methodological designs to test the effects of power posing. In Study 1, we randomly assigned 120 students to one of two power posing groups or a control group. All participants completed the State Self-Esteem Scale before and after the intervention. In Study 2, we examined effects outside the laboratory in a natural environment. We asked 49 participants to engage in high power posing in their homes. In Study 3, a total of 98 participants took part in an independent-groups posttest design (low power posing vs. high power posing). We also controlled for participantsâ€™ awareness of the research hypotheses. Consistent with our hypotheses, high power posing significantly affected self-esteem in all three studies. Contrary to our expectations, low power posing had no effect on self-esteem in Study 1. Possible explanations and implications are discussed."
"Dominance and prestige: Meta-analytic review of experimentally induced body position effects on behavioral, self-report, and physiological dependent variables.","Körner, R., Röseler, L., Schütz, A., & Bushman, B. J.",2022,"Early research on body positions suggested that engaging in certain nonverbal displays can lead to changes in self-report, behavioral, and physiological dependent variables. Still, there has been intense criticism regarding the replicability of these effects. To determine what effects are valid, we conducted a meta-analytic review on body position studies. We used the dominance–prestige framework and distinguished between high-power poses representing dominance and upright postures representing prestige. We preregistered our meta-analysis, used the largest sample of studies thus far, and analyzed several theoretical and exploratory moderator variables. Based on 313 effects from 88 studies involving 9,779 participants, evidence was obtained for an overall statistically significant effect of body positions that was not trivial in size, g = 0.35 (95% CI [0.28,0.42]). Both the poses and postures showed effects for self-report and behavioral dependent variables but not for physiological dependent variables. However, sensitivity analyses suggested that effects for behavioral dependent variables were influenced by publication bias and/or outliers. Effects were noticeably larger in studies without cover stories and in studies that used within-subjects designs, suggesting that demand characteristics might partially explain the results. Whether participants were male or female, students or nonstudents, or from an individualistic or collectivistic culture did not make a difference. We also present an app that researchers can use to enter data from future studies and thus obtain up-to-date meta-analytical results on this topic. Future research should investigate whether high-power poses/upright postures increase effects and/or whether low-power poses/slumped postures decrease effects."
Dominance or prestige: A review of the effects of power poses and other body postures,"Robert Körner, Astrid Schütz,",2020,"Research on the effects of body positions has attracted enormous attention in recent years but has been plagued by failed replication attempts. Today, there is some confusion about which effects can be considered reliable. One problem that may have contributed to this confusion is the fact that most previous studies have not clearly distinguished between different types of body positions. We apply the dominance-prestige framework to distinguish between two types of body positions. On the basis of this reasoning, we argue that research on so-called power poses in fact has analyzed expansiveness as an indicator of dominance, whereas research on postures has focused on the straightness of the spine, which may be seen as a display of prestige. We review the literature and conclude that there is no clear evidence that short-term interventions involving body positions affect physiology or behavior. Still, there are effects on actors' self-perceptions. Repeatedly, studies on power poses have found effects on feelings of power and self-evaluations, and studies on postures have found effects on emotional experience. However, there is hardly any research that has directly compared the two types of interventions."
Do Open or Closed Postures Boost Creative performance? The Effects of Postural Feedback on Divergent and Convergent Thinking,"Nicolas Michinov, E. Michinov",2021,"Can an individualâ€™s body posture (expansive or contractive) affect their creative thinking (divergent or convergent)? Based on embodied cognition and the debate about the impact of nonverbal physical postures expressing power on psychological and behavioral outcomes, five experiments were conducted. We tested the prediction that expansive postures would have a positive effect on creativity tasks that have no right or wrong answer or optimal solution (divergent thinking), whereas contractive postures would have a positive effect on tasks with a right answer or an optimal solution (convergent thinking). As predicted, results revealed a positive effect of expansive postures on performance of creativity tasks requiring divergent thinking, such as producing original ideas (Study 1) or objects, either by combining shapes to create an original toy (Study 2) or by combining fragments to produce an original drawing (Study 3). Conversely, a positive effect of contractive postures was found on performance of insight tasks requiring convergent thinking, in which participants had to associate elements to discover a unifying and correct solution (Study 4) or overcome initial task constraints to find an optimal solution to a problem (Study 5). These findings open up new avenues for research in embodied creativity."
Effects of two dominance manipulations on the stress response: Cognitive and embodied influences.,"Christian E. Deuter, Hartmut SchÃ¤chinger, Daniel Best, Roland Neumann",2016,"In response to stress, physiological and mental resources are allocated towards those systems that are needed for rapid responding in terms of fight or flight. On the other hand, long term regenerative processes such as growth, digestion and reproduction are attenuated. Levels of the sex steroid testosterone are reduced in participants that suffer from chronic stress. However, beyond its role for reproductive functions, testosterone plays an important role in the regulation of social status and dominance, testosterone levels increase during competition or when the social status is challenged. The Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), a laboratory stressor with a substantial social-evaluative component, can provoke an increase in salivary testosterone levels. Still, so far the reported findings regarding acute stress effects on testosterone are equivocal, possibly due to moderating effects. In this study we experimentally manipulated social dominance in 56 healthy participants (28m) by two independent manipulations (body posture and cognitive role taking) and subjected them to the TSST. We analyzed salivary testosterone and cortisol levels as dependent measures for the endocrine stress response. The role taking manipulation interacted with the testosterone response: we found the strongest increase when participants had to put themselves in a dominant (vs. submissive) role. Our results suggest that transient changes in testosterone levels during stress reflect a response to status threat that is affected by social dominance."
Effects of various sitting and standing postures on arousal and valence,"Aya Takayama, H. Sekiya",2023,"According to research on the effects of posture on psychological states, high-power posesâ€”with the body spread wide openâ€”lead to high-arousal positive emotions, whereas low-power posesâ€”with the body slumped and constrictedâ€”lead to low-arousal negative emotions. However, postures that lead to both high-arousal negative and low-arousal positive emotions have not been investigated yet. Although relative comparisons between postures have been made, the positioning of postures on the two-dimensional coordinates created by arousal and valence has not been clarified. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore and clarify which postures lead to the four types of emotions: high-arousal negative, high-arousal positive, low-arousal negative, and low-arousal positive. In Experiment 1, 29 participants (13 men and 16 women) adopted 12 sitting postures for 1 minute each. In Experiment 2, 25 participants (13 men and 12 women) adopted six sitting and six standing postures for 1 minute each. Arousal and valence were measured after each posture, and heart rate was measured during posture maintenance. Arousal and valence after adopting the postures were compared with the neutral arousal and valence. As a result, postures leading to high-arousal negative and low-arousal positive emotions were identified. In addition, postures leading to high-arousal positive emotions, which are the high-power poses, were identified. There were no differences in the magnitude of psychological effects between sitting and standing postures."
"Embodied power, testosterone, and overconfidence as a causal pathway to risk-taking","Richard Ronay, J. Tybur, Dian van Huijstee, M. Morssinkhof",2017,"Previous work has found that configuring participants into high-power versus low-power physical postures caused increases in subjective feelings of power, testosterone, and risk-taking as well as decreases in cortisol. We attempted to replicate and extend this pattern of findings by testing for the mediating role of testosterone and overconfidence in the relationship between power poses and risk-taking. We hypothesized that increases in testosterone in response to high-power poses would lead to increases in overconfidence, and that this indirect pathway would mediate the effect of power posing on risk-taking. We were unable to replicate the findings of the original study and subsequently found no evidence for our extended hypotheses. Overconfidence was unaffected by power posing and unrelated to testosterone, cortisol, and risk-taking. As our replication attempt was conducted in the Netherlands, we discuss the possibility that cultural differences may play a moderating role in determining the physiological and psychological effects of power posing."
Embodying Power,"Katie E Garrison, David Tang, B. Schmeichel",2016,"Adopting expansive (vs. contractive) body postures may influence psychological states associated with power. The current experiment sought to replicate and extend research on the power pose effect by adding another manipulation that embodies powerâ€”eye gaze. Participants (N = 305) adopted expansive (high power) or contractive (low power) poses while gazing ahead (i.e., dominantly) or down at the ground (i.e., submissively). Afterward, participants played a hypothetical ultimatum game, made a gambling decision, and reported how powerful and in charge they felt. Neither body posture nor eye gaze influenced the gambling decision, and contrary to the predictions, adopting an expansive pose reduced feelings of power. We also found that holding a direct gaze increased the probability of rejecting a low offer on the ultimatum game. We consider why power posing did not have the predicted effects."
Empowering Mimicry: Female Leader Role Models Empower Women in Leadership Tasks Through Body Posture Mimicry,"Ioana M Latu, Marianne Schmid Mast, Dario Bombari, Joris Lammers, Crystal L. Hoyt",2019,"In two studies we investigated the behavioral process through which visible female leader role models empower women in leadership tasks. We proposed that women tend to mimic the powerful (open) body postures of successful female role models, thus leading to more empowered behavior and better performance on a challenging leadership task, a process we called empowering mimicry. In Study 1, we experimentally manipulated the body posture of the male and female role models and showed that 86 Swiss college women mimicked the body posture of the female (ingroup) but not the male (outgroup) role model, thus leading to more empowered behavior and better performance on a public speaking task. In Study 2, we investigated the boundary conditions of this process and showed that empowering mimicry does not extend to exposures to non-famous female models among 50 Swiss college women. These findings suggest that nonverbal mimicry is one important mechanism through which female leader role models inspire women performing a challenging leadership task. From a practice perspective, our research underscores the importance of female leaders' visibility because visibility can drive other women's advancement in leadership by affording women the opportunity to mimic and be empowered by successful female role models."

Zeelenberg, Kellylynn Zuni",2015,"Empirically analyzing empirical evidence One of the central goals in any scientific endeavor is to understand causality. Experiments that seek to demonstrate a cause/effect relation most often manipulate the postulated causal factor. Aarts et al. describe the replication of 100 experiments reported in papers published in 2008 in three high-ranking psychology journals. Assessing whether the replication and the original experiment yielded the same result according to several criteria, they find that about one-third to one-half of the original findings were also observed in the replication study. Science, this issue 10.1126/science.aac4716 A large-scale assessment suggests that experimental reproducibility in psychology leaves a lot to be desired. INTRODUCTION Reproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown. Scientific claims should not gain credence because of the status or authority of their originator but by the replicability of their supporting evidence. Even research of exemplary quality may have irreproducible empirical findings because of random or systematic error. RATIONALE There is concern about the rate and predictors of reproducibility, but limited evidence. Potentially problematic practices include selective reporting, selective analysis, and insufficient specification of the conditions necessary or sufficient to obtain the results. Direct replication is the attempt to recreate the conditions believed sufficient for obtaining a previously observed finding and is the means of establishing reproducibility of a finding with new data. We conducted a large-scale, collaborative effort to obtain an initial estimate of the reproducibility of psychological science. RESULTS We conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. There is no single standard for evaluating replication success. Here, we evaluated reproducibility using significance and P values, effect sizes, subjective assessments of replication teams, and meta-analysis of effect sizes. The mean effect size (r) of the replication effects (Mr = 0.197, SD = 0.257) was half the magnitude of the mean effect size of the original effects (Mr = 0.403, SD = 0.188), representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had significant results (P < .05). Thirty-six percent of replications had significant results; 47% of original effect sizes were in the 95% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams. CONCLUSION No single indicator sufficiently describes replication success, and the five indicators examined here are not the only ways to evaluate reproducibility. Nonetheless, collectively these results offer a clear conclusion: A large portion of replications produced weaker evidence for the original findings despite using materials provided by the original authors, review in advance for methodological fidelity, and high statistical power to detect the original effect sizes. Moreover, correlational evidence is consistent with the conclusion that variation in the strength of initial evidence (such as original P value) was more predictive of replication success than variation in the characteristics of the teams conducting the research (such as experience and expertise). The latter factors certainly can influence replication success, but they did not appear to do so here. Reproducibility is not well understood because the incentives for individual scientists prioritize novelty over replication. Innovation is the engine of discovery and is vital for a productive, effective scientific enterprise. However, innovative ideas become old news fast. Journal reviewers and editors may dismiss a new test of a published idea as unoriginal. The claim that â€œwe already know thisâ€ belies the uncertainty of scientific evidence. Innovation points out paths that are possible; replication points out paths that are likely; progress relies on both. Replication can increase certainty when findings are reproduced and promote innovation when they are not. This project provides accumulating evidence for many findings in psychological research and suggests that there is still more work to do to verify whether we know what we think we know.

Expand your body when you look at yourself: The role of the posture in a mirror exposure task,"Marta Miragall, E. Etchemendy, A. Cebolla, Victor H. Rodriguez, C. Medrano, R. BaÃ±os",2018,"Mirror exposure (ME) is one of the main components of the treatment of patients with eating disorders symptomatology and it has shown its effectiveness in improving several outcomes (e.g., body dissatisfaction). However, the study as to what body posture should be adopted to maximize its effectiveness has been neglected. From embodied cognition and emotion theories, the adoption of an expansive (vs. contractive) body posture has been associated with positive changes in cognitive and emotional responses. The objective of this study was to analyze the effect of adopting an expansive (vs. contractive) posture before an ME task on body-related emotions and cognitions, as well as to analyze the possible moderator and mediator variables of these relationships. The sample was composed of 68 women (age: M = 21.74, SD = 3.12) with high scores on body dissatisfaction. Participants were randomly assigned to the expansive or contractive condition, where the openness of the arms/legs and the back position were manipulated. Posture was monitored by an electronic device and participants filled out several self-reported measures. ANCOVAs, moderation, mediation, and moderated mediated analyses were performed. Results showed that women in the expansive condition showed higher positive emotions after the ME. Moreover, exploratory analyses showed that adopting an expansive posture improved positive emotions, leading to improvements in negative emotions, body image satisfaction, and appraisal of the personâ€™s own body. Psychological interventions should explore the value of holding an expansive posture before the ME in women with body dissatisfaction."
Expansive and Contractive Postures and Movement: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of the Effect of Motor Displays on Affective and Behavioral Responses,"E. ElkjÃ¦r, M. B. Mikkelsen, J. Michalak, D. Mennin, M. O'Toole",2020,"This review and meta-analysis explores the experimental effects of expansive and contractive motor displays on affective, hormonal, and behavioral responses. Experimental studies were located through systematic literature searches. Studies had to manipulate motor displays to either expansive or contractive displays and investigate the effect of the displays on affect, hormones, or overt behavior. Meta-analyses were conducted to determine the pooled, standardized mean differences between the effects of motor displays on affective, hormonal, and behavioral responses. From 5,819 unique records, 73 relevant studies were identified. Robust differences between expansive and contractive displays emerged for affective responses and overt behavioral responses across contexts, type of manipulation, and methods of measurement. The results suggest that the effects are driven by the absence of contractive motor displays (contractive vs. neutral displays: Hedgesâ€™s g = 0.45) rather than the presence of expansive displays (expansive vs. neutral displays: g = 0.06). The findings stand as a corrective to previous research, as they indicate that it is the absence of contractive displays rather than the presence of expansive displays that alters affective and behavioral responding. Future research should include neutral control groups, use different methods to assess hormonal change, and investigate these effects in the context of ideographic goals."
EXPLORING PSYCHO-SOMATIC IMPLICATIONS OF YOGA PRACTICES â€“ A STRATEGIC INQUIRY,"Sudesh Bhardwaj, N. K. Rathee",2018,"Benefits of yogic practices are well documented, and its popularity is increasing day by day across the world. Yoga has gained new avenues and has started to explore the new facts and hidden benefits by objectively testing the potential benefits of yogic practices for human well-being and holistic health. The present research adopts a philosophical descriptive approach to analyze the popular belief regarding the psychosomatic qualities developed through yogic practices. An opinionnaire consisting to two broad themes was designed to obtain the responses from the surveyed yoga practitioners (N=400: Male=200 and Female=200), aged 18 to 25 years. Data was statistically analyzed to find out the somatic and psychological qualities that the subjects perceived were developed through yoga practices. The results indicated that the female participants believed that yoga practices will much contribute to their Stability and Balance, while the male subjects believed it will help them in developing their Core Strength. With regard to the psychological qualities, both male and female subjects listed Self-Confidence as their first preference. Overall, the subjects believed that the yogic practices can be quite useful to promote somatic qualities of stability and balance, and core strength. Regarding the psychological qualities, self-confidence and mental rejuvenation were found to be most favorable reasons to practice yoga. Implications of the study have been discussed and the recommendations for future research have been made.      Article visualizations:"
Feeling Small or Standing Tall? Height Manipulation Affects Speech Anxiety and Arousal in Virtual Reality.,(missing authors),2023,"Social performance situations often constitute one of the most challenging communication tasks across different cultures. In today's work environments, giving presentations and performing in front of others are often essential and expected. Therefore, public speaking anxiety can have a serious impact on an individual's job performance, career choice, and prospects. Contemporary consumer virtual reality hardware has made it possible to practice public speaking anywhere in a safe and private virtual reality environment (VRE). As VREs offer the means to practice real-life scenarios, they also make it possible to go beyond what is ""real""; to replace simulations with more dynamic and innovative training environments. Furthermore, with occupational life undergoing a significant shift toward technology-mediated working conditions, innovative tools and methods could also be used during virtually implemented real-time social interactions. This research aimed to study the ways in which an illusion of height, that is, perceived tallness versus perceived shortness, without any visible virtual body or representation, influences state speech anxiety and emotional responses of participants during simulation of a stressful speech task. The experiment followed a strictly controlled between-subject procedure, and both self-reported and psychophysiological data were collected. Results indicate that participants perceiving the illusion of tallness felt less anxious and had lower self-reported arousal compared with participants with the illusion of shortness. This implies that even simple, visual, first-person perspective manipulation of the VRE could help individuals to reduce their stress responses during a task-oriented situation."
"Gender, Nonverbal Communication, and Televised Debates: A Case Study Analysis of Clinton and Trumpâ€™s Nonverbal Language During the 2016 Town Hall Debate",Ben Wasike,2019,"This case study analyzed nonverbal cues during the 2016 town hall debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Variables were facial expressions, posture, eye contact, and spatial distance. Clinton was friendlier, took more expansive postures, and maintained more eye contact. The candidates largely kept within social distance, except for an instance that created postdebate controversy. Whereas some of Clintonâ€™s nonverbal behavior conformed to established gendered cues, her nonverbal behavior largely transcended gender norms. Also addressed are the mediaâ€™s shortcomings in contextualizing debate visuals."
How Relevant are Incidental Power Poses for HCI?,"Yvonne Jansen, Kasper HornbÃ¦k",2018,"The concept of power pose originates from a Psychology study from 2010 which suggested that holding an expansive pose can change hormone levels and increase risk-taking behavior. Follow-up experiments suggested that expansive poses incidentally imposed by the design of an environment lead to more dishonest behaviors. While multiple replication attempts of the 2010 study failed, the follow-up experiments on incidental postures have so far not been replicated. As UI design in HCI can incidentally lead to expansive body postures, we attempted two conceptual replications: we first asked 44 participants to tap areas on a wall-sized display and measured their self-reported sense of power; we then asked 80 participants to play a game on a large touch-screen and measured risk-taking. Based on Bayesian analyses we find that incidental power poses had little to no effect on our measures but could cause physical discomfort. We conclude by discussing our findings in the context of theory-driven research in HCI."
Improving interoceptive ability through the practice of power posing: A pilot study,"Felicitas Weineck, M. Messner, G. Hauke, O. Pollatos",2019,"Interoception refers to the detection and perception of signals from the inner body. Deficits in this domain have been linked to psychopathologies, prompting the search for strategies to improve this ability. Preliminary studies have shown that interoception could be enhanced through the manipulation of subjective feelings of power. We tested the effects of adopting powerful postures on different facets of interoception. Firstly, we measured the impact of a single power posing session on interoceptive ability in 41 healthy females. Then, the same participants were randomly assigned to two conditions (daily power posing practice vs. no practice). After one week the conditions alternated. Interoceptive accuracy, measured by the heartbeat tracking task, interoceptive sensibility, measured by the Body Perception Questionnaire (BPQ) and confidence ratings, as well as subjective feelings of power were assessed at baseline, after a single power posing session and after one week of training. A single power posing session significantly increased individuals' interoceptive accuracy. Also, power posing reduced individuals' scores on the BPQ after one week of daily practice and increased subjective feelings of power after one session and one week of daily practice. These findings suggest that adopting powerful postures has the potential to increase interoceptive accuracy, as well as subjective feelings of power, and to reduce interoceptive sensibility, measured by questionnaire."
Kinds of Replication: Examining the Meanings of â€œConceptual Replicationâ€ and â€œDirect Replicationâ€,"Maarten Derksen, J. Morawski",2022,"Although psychologyâ€™s recent crisis has been attributed to various scientific practices, it has come to be called a â€œreplication crisis,â€ prompting extensive appraisals of this putatively crucial scientific practice. These have yielded disagreements over what kind of replication is to be preferred and what phenomena are being explored, yet the proposals are all grounded in a conventional philosophy of science. This article proposes another avenue that invites moving beyond a discovery metaphor of science to rethink research as enabling realities and to consider how empirical findings enact or perform a reality. An enactment perspective appreciates multiple, dynamic realities and science as producing different entities, enactments that ever encounter differences, uncertainties, and precariousness. The axioms of an enactment perspective are described and employed to more fully understand the two kinds of replication that predominate in the crisis disputes. Although the enactment perspective described here is a relatively recent development in philosophy of science and science studies, some of its core axioms are not new to psychology, and the article concludes by revisiting psychologistsâ€™ previous calls to apprehend the dynamism of psychological reality to appreciate how scientific practices actively and unavoidably participate in performativity of reality."
Meeting your inner super(wo)man: are power poses effective when taught?,"Victor N. Keller, D. J. Johnson, Jenna A. Harder",2017,"Researchers have argued that power poses are an effective way for individuals to empower themselves to achieve personal goals. However, in laboratory studies, individuals are often unaware of the function of the poses; in real-world settings, participants must know the function of the pose in order to deliberately use it. We tested whether power poses are effective when an individual knows their consequences by directly manipulating awareness of the function of power poses. We found no evidence for the overall effect of power poses or an interaction with awareness on both traditional measures of power and a more ecologically valid assessment. Our results suggest the benefits of using power poses outside laboratory settings are limited."
Neurophysiology of Emotions,Maurizio Oggiano,2022,"Emotions are automatic and primary patterns of purposeful cognitive-behavioral organizations. They have three main functions: coordination, signaling, and information. First, emotions coordinate organs and tissues, thus predisposing the body to peculiar responses. Scholars have not reached a consensus on the plausibility of emotion-specific response patterns yet. Despite the limitations, data support the hypothesis of specific response patterns for distinct subtypes of emotions. Second, emotional episodes signal the current state of the individual. Humans display their state with verbal behaviors, nonverbal actions (e.g., facial movements), and neurovegetative signals. Third, emotions inform the brain for interpretative and evaluative purposes. Emotional experiences include mental representations of arousal, relations, and situations. Every emotional episode begins with exposure to stimuli with distinctive features (i.e., elicitor). These inputs can arise from learning, expressions, empathy, and be inherited, or rely on limited aspects of the environment (i.e., sign stimuli). The existence of the latter ones in humans is unclear; however, emotions influence several processes, such as perception, attention, learning, memory, decision-making, attitudes, and mental schemes. Overall, the literature suggests the nonlinearity of the emotional process. Each section outlines the neurophysiological basis of elements of emotion."
Nonverbal behavior and the vertical dimension of social relations: a meta-analysis.,"Judith A. Hall, Erik J. Coats, Lavonia Smith LeBeau",2005,"The vertical dimension of interpersonal relations (relating to dominance, power, and status) was examined in association with nonverbal behaviors that included facial behavior, gaze, interpersonal distance, body movement, touch, vocal behaviors, posed encoding skill, and others. Results were separately summarized for people's beliefs (perceptions) about the relation of verticality to nonverbal behavior and for actual relations between verticality and nonverbal behavior. Beliefs/perceptions were stronger and much more prevalent than were actual verticality effects. Perceived and actual relations were positively correlated across behaviors. Heterogeneity was great, suggesting that verticality is not a psychologically uniform construct in regard to nonverbal behavior. Finally, comparison of the verticality effects to those that have been documented for gender in relation to nonverbal behavior revealed only a limited degree of parallelism."
P-Curving a More Comprehensive Body of Research on Postural Feedback Reveals Clear Evidential Value for Power-Posing Effects: Reply to Simmons and Simonsohn (2017),"Amy J. C. Cuddy, S. J. Schultz, N. Fosse",2017,"We conducted a series of p-curve analyses, following Simonsohn et al.â€™s rules of p-curving and using a systematically selected, comprehensive and updated set of published studies of â€œpower posingâ€ (i.e., postural feedback), comprising 55 studies (vs. 34 studies), which yield starkly different results and conclusions from those of Simmons and Simonsohn (S&S): 
(1) evidential value for postural feedback across aggregated effects; 
(2) evidential value for a clearly specified single effect â€“ feelings of power â€“ which was omitted from the p-curve analyses presented by SS and 
(3) remarkably strong evidential value for a well-defined, theoretically-important category of effects from the same set of studies identified in our systematic review - all measures of â€œfeelings,â€ including emotions, affect, mood, and evaluations, attitudes, and feelings about the self. 
This third p-curving analysis of the set of emotions-related effects, which include methods and variables that are more resilient to demand characteristics, either because responses were implicit or otherwise difficult for participants to control, responses were embedded in a broader survey instrument, or, as demonstrated in recent research on demand effects in survey research, participants likely varied in their orientation such that some would have wanted to confirm the hypothesis, some to disconfirm it, and others would have been indifferent, also demonstrate that power posing effects are not merely demand effects. How did two groups of researchers reach such divergent findings and conclusions about the same area of research? 
Our analyses reveal two of the practices that contributed: 
(1) sample selection decisions that may lead to an incomplete or non-representative set of studies and/or effects for inclusion in the analysis; and 
(2) undifferentiated aggregation of disparate effects (i.e., the apples-and-oranges problem)."
"Power, approach, and inhibition.","D. Keltner, D. Gruenfeld, C. Anderson",2003,"This article examines how power influences behavior. Elevated power is associated with increased rewards and freedom and thereby activates approach-related tendencies. Reduced power is associated with increased threat, punishment, and social constraint and thereby activates inhibition-related tendencies. The authors derive predictions from recent theorizing about approach and inhibition and review relevant evidence. Specifically, power is associated with (a) positive affect, (b) attention to rewards, (c) automatic information processing, and (d) disinhibited behavior. In contrast, reduced power is associated with (a) negative affect; (b) attention to threat, punishment, others' interests, and those features of the self that are relevant to others' goals; (c) controlled information processing; and (d) inhibited social behavior. The potential moderators and consequences of these power-related behavioral patterns are discussed."
Powerful and confident children through expansive body postures? A preregistered study of fourth graders,"Robert KÃ¶rner, Hannes KÃ¶hler, Astrid SchÃ¼tz",2020,"Do expansive body postures increase self-esteem in children? Power posing is a popular but also controversial topic. Still, there has been no research on the possible effects in children. To investigate the influence of power posing in children, 108 German fourth graders were randomly assigned to a high versus a low power posing group. Self-esteem was self-reported; feelings were assessed indirectly. There was an effect of power posing on self-reported global and school self-esteem. Furthermore, children who had performed high power poses in comparison with those who had performed low power poses mentioned more positive feelings, higher power feelings, and a more positive student–teacher relationship. Results are interpreted with regard to the context and the cultural dependency of the power posing effect. Implications for school practice are addressed."
Powerful postures do not lead to risky behaviors,"Outong Chen, Zhaoning Yang, Xuyun Tan, Zibei Gu, Jun Chen",2019,"Recent research has found that a specific manipulation of body postures can influence psychological states associated with power, including an individualâ€™s feeling of power and risk-taking tendency, but the results vary. The purpose of this study is to replicate previous studies. A pilot experiment examined the validity of 10 postures extracted from multiple former studies. Only 4 postures were consistent with former studies. Experiment 1 replicates the study conducted by Carney, Cuddy, and Yap (2010). The results revealed that posture manipulations did not affect the participantsâ€™ risk-taking tendency. Experiment 2 is a preregistered experiment to replicate the study of Carney et al. (2010). Different from Experiment 1, data were analyzed with a Bayesian approach. The results of the former study again failed to be replicated, which indicates that the posture manipulations could not yield any effect on both power feelings and individualsâ€™ risk-taking tendency. Thus, we concluded that (a) holding a specific series of body posture perceived as high or low power does not affect individualsâ€™ feeling of power, and (b) holding a specific series of body posture perceived as high or low power does not affect individualsâ€™ risk-taking tendency."
Powerful Postures Versus Powerful Roles,"Li Huang, A. Galinsky, D. Gruenfeld, Lucia E Guillory",2011,"Three experiments explored whether hierarchical role and body posture have independent or interactive effects on the main outcomes associated with power: action in behavior and abstraction in thought. Although past research has found that being in a powerful role and adopting an expansive body posture can each enhance a sense of power, two experiments showed that when individuals were placed in high- or low-power roles while adopting an expansive or constricted posture, only posture affected the implicit activation of power, the taking of action, and abstraction. However, even though role had a smaller effect on the downstream consequences of power, it had a stronger effect than posture on self-reported sense of power. A final experiment found that posture also had a larger effect on action than recalling an experience of high or low power. We discuss body postures as one of the most proximate correlates of the manifestations of power."
Power moves: complementarity in dominant and submissive nonverbal behavior.,"L. Tiedens, Alison R. Fragale",2003,"Two studies examine complementarity (vs. mimicry) of dominant and submissive nonverbal behaviors. In the first study, participants interacted with a confederate who displayed either dominance (through postural expansion) or submission (through postural constriction). On average, participants exposed to a dominant confederate decreased their postural stance, whereas participants exposed to a submissive confederate increased their stance. Further, participants with complementing responses (dominance in response to submission and submission in response to dominance) liked their partner more and were more comfortable than those who mimicked. In the second study, complementarity and mimicry were manipulated, and complementarity resulted in more liking and comfort than mimicry. The findings speak to the likelihood of hierarchical differentiation."
Power poses - where do we stand?,"K. Jonas, Joseph Cesario, M. Alger, April H. Bailey, Dario Bombari, D. Carney, J. Dovidio, Sean Duffy, Jenna A. Harder, Dian van Huistee, B. Jackson, D. J. Johnson, Victor N. Keller, Lukas Klaschinski, Onawa P. LaBelle, M. LaFrance, Ioana M Latu, Margot Morssinkhoff, Kelly A. Nault, Vaani Pardal, Caroline Pulfrey, N. Rohleder, Richard Ronay, L. Richman, M. S. Mast, Konrad Schnabel, Michaela SchrÃ¶der-AbÃ©, J. Tybur",2017,"As editors, reviewers, and authors, we are very pleased with the output of this Special Issue. We received a robust number of interesting and diverse submissions, and we were very lucky to convince one of the authors of the original effect, Dana Carney, to review all submissions and to give feedback from an insider’s perspective. This is unique and linked to the preregistration format of this Special Issue, as this most likely would not have happened if all authors had independently approached the original researchers. Finally, the format of preregistration allowed us to run a meta-analysis across the individual studies without any file drawer bias (or the need to correct for it). In sum, we believe that peer-reviewed preregistration projects and associated meta-analyses form the gold standard for future similar endeavors. This format allows for the optimal use of resources and collaboration among original authors, new authors, and meta-analytic perspectives. Still, there is room for improvement and learning. Although we were able to coordinate the measure of felt power to be included across the studies in the special issue, further coordination of more dependent variables or similar designs could be beneficial. Such procedures can provide a more robust basis to judge where we stand with a research field.

While some colleagues have hoped that this Special Issue would provide the definitive answer on the replicability and evidence for or against power poses, we believe that conclusions need to be appropriately tempered. Looking across the studies, it is clear that an effect on felt power was observed. What this means, in terms of whether this is more than just a demand characteristic, is still unclear and can use further investigation. Considering the preregistered predictions for the behavioral and hormonal measures, however, presents a clearer picture:

Bailey, LaFrance, and Dovidio (Citation2017) sought to investigate an interaction of power posing, target gender, and participant gender. They did not replicate the effect of power poses on risky behavior.

Bombari, Schmid Mast, and Pulfrey (Citation2017) planned to test whether imagined or performed power poses had similar effects. They did not replicate the effect of power poses on risky behavior.

Klaschinski, Schnabel, and Schröder-Abé (Citation2017) wanted to replicate the effects of power posing on dominance and social sensitivity in an interview context, but they did not replicate the effects.

Jackson, Nault, Smart Richman, LaBelle, and Rohleder (Citation2017) sought to test the effect of power posing on self-concept. Although a preliminary study obtained an interesting effect, they did not replicate this in the higher-powered, preregistered study.

Keller, Johnson, and Harder (Citation2017) wanted to test whether awareness of the function of power poses moderates their effectiveness. They did not replicate the basic power pose effect.

Latu, Duffy, Pardal, and Alger (Citation2017) tested an interesting dependent variable in the context of power poses, persuasive messages. They did not observe any effect of power poses on persuasive message perception.

Ronay, Tybur, van Huijstee, and Morssinkhoff (Citation2017) wanted to investigate the mediating role of testosterone and overconfidence on the link between power posing and risk taking, but they did not replicate the effect.

As can be seen, there was virtually zero effect of power poses on any of the behavioral or hormonal measures. However, a strong contribution of preregistration is evident in the exploratory analyses conducted across the different studies. Most of the studies did reveal some effects of power poses on non-preregistered, exploratory analyses. The preregistration format, rather than inhibiting scientific discovery or exploration, actually then points researchers to the next direction for their research, while at the same time making it clear to the reader that such obtained effects were exploratory and not confirmatory.

Prior to our special issue, there were other attempts to replicate the power pose effect (Garrison, Tang, & Schmeichel, Citation2016; Ranehill et al., Citation2015). Ranehill et al. could not replicate the effect on hormonal level, but found the manipulation to influence felt power. Garrison et al. also attempted to replicate the original effect and extend it with a dominance manipulation via eye gaze. They also could not find the effect on their dependent variable, an ultimatum game, nor on felt power. Based on the papers in the special issue, and prior replication attempts, one could conclude that the power pose effect on behavioral outcomes does not replicate.
Next to these individual papers and replication attempts, it is relevant to take a more abstract view. We were able to conduct a Bayesian meta-analysis on the papers of the Special Issue that contained the felt power variable (Gronau et al., Citation2017). In merely eye-balling the results of the studies in this Special Issue, we would have guessed that there was no overall effect. But we were surprised to find the (small) overall effect for felt power. Critical colleagues will remark that this finding says little about the actual power pose effect, because they see felt power as a manipulation check. Even if one would side with this argument, then there is a successful manipulation, which demands further analysis of its effects on a number of suggested and novel dependent variables and their boundary conditions. Jackson et al. (Citation2017) identified cognitive flexibility, Bombari et al. (Citation2017) participant gender, and Klaschinski et al. (Citation2017) extraversion: This is where we believe future research should start off, and can help to contribute to unpacking the power pose effect. CRSP as a journal is happy to provide a platform for this."
Power Poseur,"Joseph Cesario, David J. Johnson",2018,"Strong claims have been made that power poses can significantly improve oneâ€™s life. Starting from an evolutionary perspective, we reason that expansive poses will have no impact in more realistic situations, as in the presence of an interaction partner or when participants are aware of what the pose should accomplish. Across four dyadic studies including both commonly used outcomes and a negotiation task (which could actually have direct benefits for oneâ€™s life), we find nearly uniform null effects of holding expansive poses, despite checks confirming the success of the manipulation. For example, in two of the studies, participants watched a popular TED talk on power poses, held an expansive pose, and then completed a negotiation in the presence of a partner, as might happen in real life. We argue that researchers should stop recommending power poses as an empirically supported strategy for improving oneâ€™s life."
Power Posing,"D. Carney, Amy J. C. Cuddy, Andy J. Yap",2010,"Humans and other animals express power through open, expansive postures, and they express powerlessness through closed, contractive postures. But can these postures actually cause power? The results of this study confirmed our prediction that posing in high-power nonverbal displays (as opposed to low-power nonverbal displays) would cause neuroendocrine and behavioral changes for both male and female participants: High-power posers experienced elevations in testosterone, decreases in cortisol, and increased feelings of power and tolerance for risk; low-power posers exhibited the opposite pattern. In short, posing in displays of power caused advantaged and adaptive psychological, physiological, and behavioral changes, and these findings suggest that embodiment extends beyond mere thinking and feeling, to physiology and subsequent behavioral choices. That a person can, by assuming two simple 1-min poses, embody power and instantly become more powerful has real-world, actionable implications."

Power Posing for Increased Participation,S. Schipper,2018,"Power posing—assuming an expansive posture, such as hands
on the hips and legs spread apart—has been shown to increase
feelings of power, confidence, and willingness to take risks. Is
it possible that two minutes of power posing in the universi-
ty classroom could give students the confidence necessary to
volunteer answers in a whole-class discussion? The results of
this study support the researcher’s prediction that assuming
a powerful posture for two minutes in the classroom leads to
increased voluntary participation in whole-class discussions.
These results could have meaningful implications for teachers
struggling with low participation rates in their classrooms."
Power Posing: <i>P-</i>Curving the Evidence,"Joseph P. Simmons, Uri Simonsohn",2017,"In a well-known article, Carney, Cuddy, and Yap (2010) documented the benefits of â€œpower posingâ€. In their study, participants (N=42) who were randomly assigned to briefly adopt expansive, powerful postures sought more risk, had higher testosterone levels, and had lower cortisol levels than those assigned to adopt contractive, powerless postures. In their response to a failed replication by Ranehill et al. (2015), Carney, Cuddy, and Yap (2015) reviewed 33 successful studies investigating the effects of expansive vs. contractive posing, focusing on differences between these studies and the failed replication, to identify possible moderators that future studies could explore. But before spending valuable resources on that, it is useful to establish whether the literature that Carney et al. (2015) cited actually suggests that power posing is effective. In this paper we rely on p-curve analysis to answer the following question: Does the literature reviewed by Carney et al. (2015) suggest the existence of an effect once we account for selective reporting? We conclude not. The distribution of p-values from those 33 studies is indistinguishable from what is expected if (1) the average effect size were zero, and (2) selective reporting (of studies and/or analyses) were solely responsible for the significant effects that are published. Although more highly powered future research may find replicable evidence for the purported benefits of power posing (or unexpected detriments), the existing evidence is too weak to justify a search for moderators or to advocate for people to engage in power posing to better their lives."
"Power-Posing Robots: The Influence of a Humanoid Robotâ€™s Posture and Size on its Perceived Dominance, Competence, Eeriness, and Threat","Jan-Philipp Stein, Paula Cimander, Markus Appel",2022,"When interacting with sophisticated digital technologies, people often fall back on the same interaction scripts they apply to the communication with other humansâ€”especially if the technology in question provides strong anthropomorphic cues (e.g., a human-like embodiment). Accordingly, research indicates that observers tend to interpret the body language of social robots in the same way as they would with another human being. Backed by initial evidence, we assumed that a humanoid robot will be considered as more dominant and competent, but also as more eerie and threatening once it strikes a so-called power pose . Moreover, we pursued the research question whether these effects might be accentuated by the robotâ€™s body size. To this end, the current study presented 204 participants with pictures of the robot NAO in different poses (expansive vs. constrictive), while also manipulating its height (child-sized vs. adult-sized). Our results show that NAOâ€™s posture indeed exerted strong effects on perceptions of dominance and competence. Conversely, participantsâ€™ threat and eeriness ratings remained statistically independent of the robotâ€™s depicted body language. Further, we found that the machineâ€™s size did not affect any of the measured interpersonal perceptions in a notable way. The study findings are discussed considering limitations and future research directions."
Power posture effects on approach and avoidance decisions in response to social threat,"Hannah Metzler, Emma Vilarem, Augusto Petschen, Julie GrÃ¨zes",2020,"Individualsâ€™ opportunities for action in threatening social contexts largely depend on their social power. While powerful individuals can afford to confront aggressors and dangers, powerless individuals need othersâ€™ support and better avoid direct challenges. Here, we investigated if adopting expansive or contracted postures, which function as social signals of power, impacts individualsâ€™ approach and avoidance decisions in response to social threat signals using a within-subject design. Overall, participants more often chose to avoid rather than to approach angry individuals, but showed no clear approach or avoidance preference for fearful individuals. Crucially, contracted postures considerably increased the tendency to avoid angry individuals, whereas expansive postures induced no substantial changes. This suggests that adopting power-related postures may impact action decisions in response to social threat signals. The present results emphasize the social function of power postures, but should be replicated before drawing strong conclusions."
Power vs. persuasion: can open body postures embody openness to persuasion?,"Ioana M. Latu, Sean Duffy, Vaani Pardal, M. Alger",2017,"In the current study, we sought to replicate the finding that adopting an open/expansive body posture increases subjective feelings of power, while also investigating how these body postures influence the processing of persuasive messages. Two hundred participants were randomly assigned to adopt either an open or a closed body posture while reading either a strong or a weak persuasive message regarding junk food taxation. Afterwards, we measured participants’ attitudes toward junk food, subjective feelings of power, thought confidence, and openness. Results failed to replicate the previously found effect of body posture on subjective feelings of power. Compared to weak messages, strong messages led to more persuasion, higher subjective power, more thought confidence, and more openness. However, body posture did not affect these outcomes. Overall, these findings challenge the idea of a direct, causal relationship between open body postures and power, by showing that power posing effects are not maintained under certain conditions."
Preparatory power posing affects nonverbal presence and job interview performance.,"Amy J. C. Cuddy, C. A. Wilmuth, Andy J. Yap, D. Carney",2015,"The authors tested whether engaging in expansive (vs. contractive) ""power poses"" before a stressful job interview--preparatory power posing--would enhance performance during the interview. Participants adopted high-power (i.e., expansive, open) poses or low-power (i.e., contractive, closed) poses, and then prepared and delivered a speech to 2 evaluators as part of a mock job interview. All interview speeches were videotaped and coded for overall performance and hireability and for 2 potential mediators: verbal content (e.g., structure, content) and nonverbal presence (e.g., captivating, enthusiastic). As predicted, those who prepared for the job interview with high- (vs. low-) power poses performed better and were more likely to be chosen for hire; this relation was mediated by nonverbal presence, but not by verbal content. Although previous research has focused on how a nonverbal behavior that is enacted during interactions and observed by perceivers affects how those perceivers evaluate and respond to the actor, this experiment focused on how a nonverbal behavior that is enacted before the interaction and unobserved by perceivers affects the actor's performance, which, in turn, affects how perceivers evaluate and respond to the actor. This experiment reveals a theoretically novel and practically informative result that demonstrates the causal relation between preparatory nonverbal behavior and subsequent performance and outcomes."
Real and imagined power poses: is the physical experience necessary after all?,"Dario Bombari, M. S. Mast, Caroline Pulfrey",2017,"Previous research investigated the effects of power poses at the behavioral, subjective, and neuroendocrine level. However, it is not clear whether the same effects would be obtained also by just imagining, rather than adopting, a power pose. We planned to investigate this question by asking 200 participants to either perform or imagine a constrictive or an expansive body posture during 2 min and then measure the effect on a gambling decision task and on felt power. We followed a sequential analysis procedure by running the first 100 participants in the performed posture condition in order to check the presence of the power posing effect. Because no effect of power poses on gambling decision or on felt power was found, we ran the remaining 100 participants also in the performed instead of the imagined condition. The results after running 200 participants confirmed that power poses did not affect gambling decision. However, participants felt more powerful after adopting an expansive pose compared to a constrictive pose. Exploratory analyses found that this effect was mainly driven by male participants. In addition, participants rated themselves as being more able to adopt the expansive body posture and they reported to put more effort in adopting the restrictive body posture. Overall, our results indicate that the effect of power poses on behavior might not be as widespread as previously thought of and suggest that moderators should be investigated carefully in future research."
Repeatedly adopting power postures does not affect hormonal correlates of dominance and affiliative behavior,"Hannah Metzler, Julie GrÃ¨zes",2019,"Background Adopting expansive vs. constrictive postures related to high vs. low levels of social power has been suggested to induce changes in testosterone and cortisol levels, and thereby to mimic hormonal correlates of dominance behavior. However, these findings have been challenged by several non-replications recently. Despite this growing body of evidence that does not support posture effects on hormone levels, the question remains as to whether repeatedly holding postures over time and/or assessing hormonal responses at different time points would yield different outcomes. The current study assesses these methodological characteristics as possible reasons for previous null-findings. Additionally, it investigates for the first time whether expansive and constrictive postures impact progesterone levels, a suggested correlate of affiliative motives and behavior. By testing the effects of repeated but short posture manipulations in between the blocks of a social task while using a cover story, it further fulfills the conditions previously raised as potentially necessary for the effects to occur. Methods A total of 82 male participants repeatedly adopted an expansive or constrictive posture for 2 min in between blocks of a task that consisted in categorizing faces based on first impressions. Saliva samples were taken at two different time points in a time window in which hormonal responses to stress, competition and other manipulations are known to be strongest. Results Neither testosterone and cortisol levels linked to dominance behaviors, nor progesterone levels related to affiliative tendencies, responded differently to adopting expansive as opposed to constrictive postures. The present results suggest that even repeated power posing in a context where social stimuli are task-relevant does not elicit changes in hormone levels."
Review and Summary of Research on the Embodied Effects of Expansive (vs. Contractive) Nonverbal Displays,"D. Carney, Amy J. C. Cuddy, Andy J. Yap",2015,"In 2010, we published an article in which two experiments demonstrated that expansive (vs. contractive) nonverbal displays produced subjective feelings of power and increased risk tolerance (Carney, Cuddy, & Yap, 2010). One of these experiments demonstrated that such displays increased subjective feelings of power, risk tolerance, and testosterone, and decreased cortisol. Our two experiments were the eighth and ninth to be reported in the literature on the embodied effects of nonverbal expansivenessâ€”seven experiments on this topic were published prior to 2010. Since our article in 2010, 24 additional experiments on the effects of expansive postures have been published (see Table 1). Embodiment and the long-standing discussion of mind-body connection has its experimental roots in William Jamesâ€™s (1890/1950) theories of emotion and ideomotor action. Since then, many studies have demonstrated the bidirectional link between nonverbal behavior and human thought and feeling (see Laird & Lacasse, 2014). One such study was conducted by Ranehill et al. (2015), who reported a conceptual replication of one of our experiments: They found an effect of expansive posture on subjective feelings of power, but no effect of posture on risk tolerance, testosterone, or cortisol. We offer four comments that we hope elucidate the similarities and differences among the 33 published experiments (harvested from the literature through extensive keyword searches and cross-referencing of published articles) and the newly published research of Ranehill et al. We also highlight the specific differences between our experiment and that of Ranehill et al. Unpublished findings were excluded in Table 1. Ranehill et al.â€™s commentary, with the review presented here, serves as an excellent springboard for identifying potential moderators of the psychological effects of nonverbally expansive (vs. contractive) posture. Thirty-Three Published Results on Expansive Posture"
"Stand tall, but don't put your feet up: Universal and culturally-specific effects of expansive postures on power","Lora E. Park, Lindsey Streamer, Li Huang, Adam D. Galinsky",2013,"Previous research suggests that there is a fundamental link between expansive body postures and feelings of power. The current research demonstrates that this link is not universal, but depends on people's cultural background (Western versus East Asian) and on the particular type of expansive posture enacted. Three types of expansive postures were examined in the present studies: the expansive-hands-spread-on-desk pose ( Carney et al., 2010 ), the expansive-upright-sitting pose ( Huang et al., 2011 ,  Tiedens and Fragale, 2003 ), and the expansive-feet-on-desk pose ( Carney et al., 2010 ). Of these postures, the expansive-feet-on-desk pose was perceived by both Americans and East Asians as the least consistent with East Asian cultural norms of modesty, humility, and restraint (Study 1). The expansive-hands-spread-on-desk and expansive-upright-sitting postures led to greater sense of power than a constricted posture for both Americans and East Asians (Studies 2aâ€“2b). In contrast, the expansive-feet-on-desk pose led to greater power activation (Study 3) and action orientation (Study 4) for Americans, but not for East Asians. Indeed, East Asians in the expansive-feet-on-desk pose showed less power activation and action orientation than Americans in this pose. Together, these findings support a basic principle of embodiment â€” the effects of posture depend on: (a) the type of posture, and (b) the symbolic meaning of that posture."
The effects of walking posture on affective and physiological states during stress.,"Jessie Hackford, Anna H. Mackey, Elizabeth Broadbent",2019,"Abstract   Background and objectives  Embodiment theory proposes that motor processes are associated with emotions and cognitions. Previous research has shown that walking posture can influence affective memory bias. This study further investigated this theory by looking at the effects of an upright versus slumped walking posture on psychological and physiological states when faced with a psychological stressor.    Methods  Seventy-three healthy adults completed baseline self-report measures of affect, power, and sleepiness, and physiological measures of blood pressure, galvanic skin response, and skin temperature. After walking in their usual posture, the same self-report and physiological measures were obtained. Participants were then randomly allocated into one of two groups where they were asked to walk in either an upright posture or a slumped posture. While walking, participants underwent a psychological stressor. After experimental walking, the same self-report and physiological measures were obtained.    Results  The upright walking posture group showed significantly improved psychological states including less low arousal negative affect, less sleepiness, less pain and marginally greater feelings of power than the slumped walking posture group. Physiologically, the upright walking posture group showed significantly lower systolic blood pressure, galvanic skin response, and marginally lower skin temperature than the slumped walking posture group.    Limitations  This was a short-term laboratory-based experiment and results may not generalise to other situations.    Conclusions  Walking posture can affect both psychological and physiological states. Applications of these findings may have implications for improving mental and physiological health."
The Embodiment of Power and Visual Dominance Behaviour,"Jure Jamnik, G. Å½velc",2017,"The objective of this study was to identify whether the changes in assuming power poses during a conversation between a pair of individuals, who were previously familiar with each other, influence the hierarchy of power, changes in it, as well as maintenance and adoption of different roles in the hierarchy. We assumed changes in roles of power on the basis of changes in visual dominance behaviour, which proved to be a reliable indicator of the social power of the individual in previous researches. Each pair conversed on predefined topics three times for three minutes. By placing individuals in a neutral or expansive posture, the purpose of which was covered by the use of a cover story, we created a difference in nonverbal expression of power between the two individuals. In the first conversation, both individuals adopted a neutral pose. In the second conversation, one individual adopted an expansive posture, while the other remained in a neutral one, and vice versa in the third conversation. Interactions were filmed with two cameras, which enabled us to analyse nonverbal behaviour. The results show that the differences in displays of power with expansive body postures between individuals are not associated with changes in visual dominance behaviour of individuals. From this we conclude that in the relations in which the social hierarchy of power is already established, the use of power poses does not help increase the power of the individual who adopts the posture."
The impact of power posing on self-efficacy and dispositional optimism in horse-assisted coaching,"Sophia BrÃ¤mig, Kathrin SchÃ¼tz, Sophia BrÃ¤mig, Kathrin SchÃ¼tz",2022,"Although both power posing and equine-assisted coaching have received growing attention in recent years and accordingly attract more research, intensive scientific debate is still young. This study investigates the impact of power posing and inner images in terms of imagination on self-efficacy in the setting of horse-assisted coaching using a quasi-experimental test design with repeated measures. Participants (N = 149), aged between 16 and 78 years (M = 29.38, SD = 13.12, 80% female), belonged either to the intervention group (N = 62) or the control group (N = 87). Intervention group subjects received a horse-assisted coaching with power posing exercises. Self-efficacy was measured two times by using the Generalized Self-Efficacy Scale and dispositional optimism was assessed using the revised version of the Life Orientation Test. Results show a highly significant increase in self-efficacy and dispositional optimism through a horse-assisted coaching with power posing exercises. The change in the self-efficacy represents a strong effect. Gender and horse experience of the subjects (intervention group) did not significantly influence the change of the selfefficacy between the measuring points. Long-term effects and the different factors of action in equine-assisted coaching, which has hardly been researched so far, as well as gender- and age-specific differences should be examined more closely in follow-up studies."
The influence of bodily actions on social perception and behaviour : assessing effects of power postures,Hannah Metzler,2018,"Les  corporelles signalant domination ou soumission servent une fonction de communication chez les humains et dâ€™autres animaux. La question de savoir si l'adoption de telles postures de  influence la perception et le comportement de l'agent fait actuellement l'objet d'un debat. Le travail realise pendant cette these consistait a explorer les effets de ces  sur des comportements etroitement lies a leur fonction primaire, a savoir la communication sociale, en se focalisant sur les reponses aux visages, signaux sociaux particulierement saillants. Dans une serie d'experiences, j'ai utilise des methodes de correlation inverse pour visualiser les representations mentales de traits preferes du visage. Les representations mentales des visages preferes implicitement et explicitement evoquaient une impression affiliative et legerement dominante, mais ne revelaient aucun effet reproductible des postures. Deux autres experiences distinctes ont etudie les effets de la posture sur la perception dâ€™expressions faciales menacantes et sur les comportements d'approche ou d'evitement en reponse a ces signaux. Bien que les  n'aient pas dâ€™influence sur la reconnaissance explicite dâ€™expressions faciales menacantes, elles ont un impact sur les decisions d'approcher ou d'eviter des signaux de menace. Plus precisement, l'adoption d'une posture de soumission augmentait la tendance a eviter les personnes exprimant la colere. Enfin, une tentative de replication des effets des  sur les niveaux de testosterone et de cortisol a demontre que meme l'adoption repetee d'une posture de pouvoir en contexte social ne provoque pas de changements hormonaux. Dans l'ensemble, ces resultats suggerent que notre posture corporelle nâ€™influence pas nos representations mentales et notre perception des autres individus, mais pourrait influencer nos actions en reponse aux signaux sociaux."
The influence of power posing on cardiac vagal activity.,"Sylvain Laborde, Nils Strack, Emma Mosley",2019,"The effects of power posing on hormonal reactions such as testosterone and cortisol have been widely investigated, however, its effects on the autonomic nervous system are rather unknown. Consequently, the aim of this study was to investigate the influence of power posing on cardiac vagal activity (CVA), as indexed by heart rate variability. It was hypothesized that high power poses (HPP) would increase CVA, whereas low power poses (LPP) would decrease CVA, given power posing is expected to decrease stress. Participants (Nâ€¯=â€¯56) performed a total of four power poses, a combination of two power conditions (high vs. low) and two body positions (sitting vs. standing) for 1â€¯min each, in a randomized order. In addition, for each power pose participants were given a role description. Contrary to our hypothesis, CVA decreased significantly during HPP in comparison to the resting measures before and after HPP, and CVA did not change during LPP. Moreover, while holding the power pose, CVA was higher in the LPP than in the HPP condition. Regarding subjective measures our hypotheses were confirmed, felt power was significantly higher after HPP than after LPP. Additionally, perceived stress was higher after LPP than after HPP. Taken together, these results suggest that the immediate impact of PP on the autonomic nervous system is more likely to influence a higher state of activation within the body instead of increasing resources to cope with stress as indexed by CVA, which may be seen only on a more long-term basis."
The Role of Activation in the Relationship between Power Posing and Task Performance,J. Marshall,2020,"This research analyzed the psychophysiological effects that expansive and contractive body poses have on the human body. Participants were asked to hold either an expansive or contractive body pose for two minutes prior to participating in a Color-Word Interference Test (CWT, which induced stress) and a gambling task (which measured risk tolerance). Heart rate variability (HRV) and electrodermal activity (EDA) for each participant was measured to gauge stress throughout the experiment. Positive and negative affect scales were used to measure mood before and after posing. Results of this research did not support our hypotheses, which were: 1. Expansive, dominant poses would cause an increase in performance on the stressful task, a decrease in both psychological and psychophysiological stress response, and an increase in risk tolerance and 2. Contractive, submissive poses would yield the opposite effect. This research was unable to find a connection between posture, risk tolerance, and feelings of improved mood."
To Strike a Pose: No Stereotype Backlash for Power Posing Women,"Miriam Rennung, Johannes Blum, A. GÃ¶ritz",2016,"Power posing, the adoption of open and powerful postures, has effects that parallel those of actual social power. This study explored the social evaluation of adopting powerful vs. powerless body postures in men and women regarding perceived warmth, competence, and the likelihood of eliciting admiration, envy, pity, and contempt. Previous findings suggest that the display of power by women may have side effects due to gender stereotyping, namely reduced warmth ratings and negative emotional reactions. An experiment (N = 2,473) asked participants to rate pictures of men and women who adopted high-power or low-power body postures. High-power posers were rated higher on competence, admiration, envy, and contempt compared to low-power posers, whereas the opposite was true for pity. There was no impact of power posing on perceived warmth. Contrary to expectations, the poserâ€™s gender did not moderate any of the effects. These findings suggest that non-verbal displays of power do influence fundamental dimensions of social perception and their accompanying emotional reactions but result in comparably positive and negative evaluations for both genders."
Using bodily displays to facilitating approach action outcomes within the context of a personally relevant task,"Emma ElkjÃ¦r, Mai BjÃ¸rnskov Mikkelsen, Gitte Tramm, Johannes Michalak, Douglas S Mennin, Mia Skytte O'Toole, Emma ElkjÃ¦r, Mai BjÃ¸rnskov Mikkelsen, Gitte Tramm, Johannes Michalak, Douglas S Mennin, Mia Skytte O'Toole",2022,"Considerable attention has been paid to the effect of bodily (expansive and contractive) displays on affective, behavioral, and hormonal outcomes. However, the majority of past studies are limited by a lack of control groups with neutral displays and low personal relevance of the experimental tasks employed. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of adopting different bodily displays, including neutral displays, within the context of a personally relevant task.In an experiment with healthy participants (N = 90), we investigated the effects of two different bodily manipulations (i.e., expansive and contractive), compared to a control group (i.e., neutral displays). Effects were evaluated in terms of completed valued action in addition to processes considered potentially helpful in preparing and motivating the individual to take valued action, including a change in emotion experience, action tendencies, and appraisals.Several main effects were detected and only few significant interaction effects were revealed. In case of group differences, results showed that expansive bodily displays outperformed the control group, leading to more positive emotions, more approach action tendencies, less negative emotion variability, and less avoidance action tendencies toward threat.These results mainly suggest that identifying a valued action and explicating the underlying motivational conflict may be beneficial regardless of bodily displays. This conclusion runs somewhat counter both to our hypotheses and to findings in recent meta-analytic work. However, previous experiments have not evaluated the effect of bodily displays within a personally relevant context."
Using bodily postures in the treatment of anorexia nervosa: Effects of power posing on interoception and affective states.,"Felicitas Weineck, Gernot Hauke, Hanna Lindemann, Karin Lachenmeir, Andreas Schnebel, Matislava Karacic, Adrian Meule, Ulrich Voderholzer, Olga Pollatos",2021,"Objective  Power posing involves the adoption of an expansive bodily posture. This study examined whether power posing could benefit individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN) and women with normal weight in regards to interoceptive ability and affective states.  Method  Participants included 50 inpatients and outpatients with AN as well as 51 normal-weight women. Interoceptive accuracy (IAcc), measured by the heartbeat tracking task and interoceptive sensibility (IS), measured by confidence ratings, were assessed at baseline, after a single power posing session and after 1 week of daily training. Also, the short-term effects of power posing on subjective feelings of dominance, pleasantness, and arousal were investigated.  Results  Both groups increased in their IAcc after one power posing session. Also, there was a significant main effect of time on feelings of dominance and pleasantness in the short-term. Women with AN displayed lower levels of IS, dominance, and pleasantness as well as higher levels of arousal than women without AN.  Discussion  These findings suggest that power posing has the potential to increase IAcc, subjective feelings of power and pleasant affect in the short-term. Further research should investigate which mechanisms foster the effectiveness of this intervention to tailor it to the needs of women with AN."
Using bodily postures to reduce anxiety and improve interoception: A comparison between powerful and neutral poses,"Felicitas Weineck, Dana Schultchen, G. Hauke, M. Messner, O. Pollatos",2020,"Background Previous research has shown that anxiety syndromes are highly prevalent among university students. Effective treatments are needed to reduce the burden of anxiety in this population. Powerful postures have been found to impact affective states, as well as interoception (i.e. the ability to perceive inner bodily signals). However, no previous study has compared the effects of powerful- and neutral postures in regards to anxiety and interoceptive ability. Methods The first part of the study measured the single-session effect of adopting powerful- vs. neutral postures on students' (n = 57) interoceptive ability and state anxiety. The second part of the study measured the effect of adopting powerful or neutral postures twice daily for two weeks, on individuals' interoceptive ability and trait anxiety. Results State anxiety decreased in both conditions whereas interoceptive accuracy only increased in the power posing condition after a single session. Interoceptive accuracy increased in both groups after two weeks of training. Limitations The study included no comparison to a condition where individuals adopted their natural (i.e. usual) bodily posture. Conclusions Embodiment interventions that include elements of adopting an open or expansive bodily posture whilst maintaining a self-focus, can help to reduce state anxiety and improve interoceptive accuracy in student populations. Power posing does not seem to be superior to holding a neutral posture to improve interoceptive accuracy or anxiety. One reason therefore could be that both conditions include the manipulation of self-focus and a postural change that diverges from individuals' normal posture."
"Winners, losers, and posers: The effect of power poses on testosterone and risk-taking following competition.","Kristopher M. Smith, Coren L. Apicella",2017,"A contribution to a special issue on Hormones and Human Competition.  The effect of postural power displays (i.e. power poses) on hormone levels and decision-making has recently been challenged. While Carney et al. (2010) found that holding brief postural displays of power leads to increased testosterone, decreased cortisol and greater economic risk taking, this failed to replicate in a recent high-powered study (Ranehill et al. 2015). It has been put forward that subtle differences in social context may account for the differences in results. Power displays naturally occur within the context of competitions, as do changes in hormones, and researchers have yet to examine the effects of poses within this ecologically relevant context. Using a large sample of 247 male participants, natural winners and losers of a physical competition were randomly assigned to hold a low, neutral or high-power postural display. We found no main effect of pose type on testosterone, cortisol, risk or feelings of power. Winners assigned to a high-power pose had a relative, albeit small, rise in testosterone compared to winners who held neutral or low-power poses. For losers, we found little evidence that high-power poses lead to increased testosterone relative to those holding neutral or low-powered poses. If anything, the reverse was observed â€“ losers had a reduction in testosterone after holding high-power poses. To the extent that changes in testosterone modulate social behaviors adaptively, it is possible that the relative reduction in testosterone observed in losers taking high-powered poses is designed to inhibit further â€œwinner-likeâ€ behavior that could result in continued defeat and harm. Still, effects were small, multiple comparisons were made, and the results ran counter to our predictions. We thus treat these conclusions as preliminary."
With great power comes great responsibility: Superhero primes and expansive poses influence prosocial behavior after a motion-controlled game task,"Jorge E. PeÃ±a, Meng Chen",2017,"This study examined how priming social concepts and manipulating physical poses when playing a motion-sensing flight game affected ensuing prosocial behaviors. After the experimenter â€œaccidentallyâ€ dropped pencils, participants primed with superheroes were faster at helping compared with a control condition. Participants who controlled the game while standing and holding expansive poses helped more compared with those in the expansive pose/sitting condition. Sitting participants primed with supervillains showed decreased prosocial intention. The study expanded on previous research and addressed possible confounds by providing evidence of how social primes and physical poses affect prosocial behavior after a virtual flight task. The paper discusses theoretical implications and future directions for research interested in cognitive processes and physical mechanics in virtual experiences."
Yoga Poses Increase Subjective Energy and State Self-Esteem in Comparison to â€˜Power Posesâ€™,"Agnieszka Golec de Zavala, Dorottya Lantos, D. Bowden",2017,"Research on beneficial consequences of yoga focuses on the effects of yogic breathing and meditation. Less is known about the psychological effects of performing yoga postures. The present study investigated the effects of yoga poses on subjective sense of energy and self-esteem. The effects of yoga postures were compared to the effects of â€˜power poses,â€™ which arguably increase the sense of power and self-confidence due to their association with interpersonal dominance (Carney et al., 2010). The study tested the novel prediction that yoga poses, which are not associated with interpersonal dominance but increase bodily energy, would increase the subjective feeling of energy and therefore increase self-esteem compared to â€˜high powerâ€™ and â€˜low powerâ€™ poses. A two factorial, between participants design was employed. Participants performed either two standing yoga poses with open front of the body (n = 19), two standing yoga poses with covered front of the body (n = 22), two expansive, high power poses (n = 21), or two constrictive, low power poses (n = 20) for 1-min each. The results showed that yoga poses in comparison to â€˜power posesâ€™ increased self-esteem. This effect was mediated by an increased subjective sense of energy and was observed when baseline trait self-esteem was controlled for. These results suggest that the effects of performing open, expansive body postures may be driven by processes other than the posesâ€™ association with interpersonal power and dominance. This study demonstrates that positive effects of yoga practice can occur after performing yoga poses for only 2 min."
Embodying Power: A Preregistered Replication and Extension of the Power Pose Effect,"Garrison, K. E., Tang, D., & Schmeichel, B. J.",2016,Embodying Power: A Preregistered Replication and Extension of the Power Pose Effect
The Benefit of Power Posing Before a High-Stakes Social Evaluation,,2012,"The current experiment tested whether changing one‘s nonverbal behavior prior to a high-stakes social evaluation could improve performance in the evaluated task. Participants adopted expansive, open (high-power) poses, or contractive, closed (low-power) poses, and then prepared and delivered a speech to two evaluators as part of a mock job interview, a prototypical social evaluation. All speeches were videotaped and coded for overall performance and hireability, and the potential mediators of speech quality (e.g., content, structure) and presentation quality (e.g., captivating, confident). As predicted, high power posers performed better and were more likely to be chosen for hire, and this relationship was mediated only by presentation quality, not speech quality. Power pose condition had no effect on body posture during the social evaluation, thus highlighting the relationship between preparatory nonverbal behavior and subsequent performance."
Assessing the Robustness of Power Posing: No Effect on Hormones and Risk Tolerance in a Large Sample of Men and Women,"Eva Ranehill, Anna Dreber, Magnus Johannesson, Susanne Leiberg, Sunhae Sul, Roberto A. Weber,",2015,"In a growing body of research, psychologists have studied how physical expression influences psychological processes (see Riskind & Gotay, 1982; Stepper & Strack, 1993, for early contributions to this literature). A recent strand of literature within this field has focused on how physical postures that express power and dominance (power poses) influence psychological and physiological processes, as well as decision making (e.g., Carney, Cuddy, & Yap, 2010; Cesario & McDonald, 2013; Yap, Wazlawek, Lucas, Cuddy, & Carney, 2013). Carney et al. found that power posing affected levels of hormones such as testosterone and cortisol, financial risk taking, and self-reported feelings of power in a sample of 42 participants (randomly assigned to hold poses suggesting either high or low power). We conducted a conceptual replication study with a similar methodology as that employed by Carney et al. but using a substantially larger sample (N = 200) and a design in which the experimenter was blind to condition. Our statistical power to detect an effect of the magnitude reported by Carney et al. was more than 95% (see the Supplemental Material available online). In addition to the three outcome measures that Carney et al. used, we also studied two more behavioral tasks (risk taking in the loss domain and willingness to compete)."
A Bayesian model-averaged meta-analysis of the power pose effect with informed and default priors: the case of felt power,"Gronau, Quentin F.; Van Erp, Sara; Heck, Daniel W.; Cesario, Joseph; Jonas, Kai J.; Wagenmakers, Eric-Jan",2017,"Consistent with the findings of Carney et al., our results showed a significant effect of power posing on self-reported feelings of power. However, we found no significant effect of power posing on hormonal levels or in any of the three behavioral tasks."
"Playing with power: Power poses affect enjoyment, presence, controller responsiveness, and arousal when playing natural motion-controlled video games","Peña, Jorge; Chen, Meng",2017,"Though playing with natural versus traditional game controllers affects game experiences, studies have not investigated how power poses affect the experience of playing natural controlled video games. Participants keeping powerful poses experienced increased enjoyment, presence, and controller responsiveness compared with those holding powerless poses. Congruent with self-perception and automatic activation models, mediation analyses uncovered direct effects of power poses and also indirect effects in which power poses increased power feelings, which in turn were associated with higher enjoyment, presence, and controller responsiveness but reduced arousal. This provides initial evidence for how physical poses affect people's experiences with natural game interfaces, and highlight basic self-perception and automatic activation mechanisms behind the effect."
Should high-power posing be integrated in physical therapy?,"Ge, Weiqing; Bennett, Teale K.; Oller, Jeremy C.",2017,"[Purpose] Postural assessment and correction is a common approach in patient management to decrease symptoms and improve function for patients. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of high-power posing on muscle strength and pain threshold. [Subjects and Methods] Thirty-one subjects, 16 females and 15 males, mean age 28.9 (SD 10.8) years old, were recruited through a convenience sampling on the university campus. The research design was a randomized controlled trial. In the experimental group, the subjects were instructed to stand in a high-power posture. In the control group, the subjects were instructed to stand in a low-power posture. Grip strength and pain threshold measurements were conducted before and after the postural intervention. [Results] The grip strength changed by ?3.4 (?3.7, 0.3) % and 1.7 (?3.6, 5.3) % for the experimental and control groups, respectively. The pain threshold changed by 0.6 (?9.9, 10.4) % and 15.1 (?9.3, 24.4) % for the experimental and control groups, respectively. However, both changes were not significant as all the 95% CIs included 0. [Conclusions] The data did not show significant benefits of high-power posing in increasing grip strength and pain threshold compared to low-power posing."
Power Poses Affect Risk Tolerance and Skin Conductance Levels,"Saggese, Davide; Cordasco, Gennaro; Maldonado, Mauro N.; Bourbakis, Nikolaos; Vinciarelli, Alessandro; Esposito, Anna",2018,"Humans are used to express their feelings of selfconfidence/ powerfulness or their distress/sadness through either expansive postures that occupy as much space as possible or closing postures occupying as less space as possible to avoid contact. This conduct suggests that feelings of selfconfidence/ powerfulness or distress/sadness change our body expressions/postures. It can be interesting to assess whether the reverse is also true, i.e. the way we arrange our body at a given moment would affect our feelings. The present research reports an investigation on such argument. To this aim, 50 subjects (25 females) aged between 23 and 31 years were requested to adopt either an expansive (high-powered) or contracted (low-powered) posture for as long as 3 minutes and then asked to bet money in a dice game. The results show that assuming high-power poses favors risk tolerant behaviors and rises feelings of powerfulness. This is not true in the case of low-power postures, which engender a sense of stress, sustained by a significant increase of skin conductance levels. Considerations are made on how to exploit these results for psychotherapy and rehabilitation purposes, as well as, for the implementation of artificial intelligent systems operating as tools for well-being and coaching."
"A Negative Effect of a Contractive Pose Is Not Evidence for the Positive Effect of an Expansive Pose: Commentary on Cuddy, Schultz, and Fosse (2018)","Crede, Marcus",2018,"Cuddy, Schultz, and Fosse (2018) present p-curve analyses of the literature on postural feedback and conclude that their results are supportive of the inference that expansive poses (i.e., power poses) have positive effects on feelings of power and emotional/affective states. These inferences are incorrect because most of the examined studies cannot distinguish between the effects of an expansive pose and the effects of a contractive pose. Further, the few studies that can speak to these two effects suggest that an overall effect of posture is primarily due to the negative effects of a contractive pose (e.g., slouching) and not the positive effect of an expansive pose."
"Revisiting the Power Pose Effect: How Robust Are the Results Reported by Carney, Cuddy, and Yap (2010) to Data Analytic Decisions?","Credé, Marcus; Phillips, Leigh A.",2017,"The literature on the impact of expansive poses on biological and psychological variables is characterized by discrepant findings. These discrepant findings may, in part, be a function of differences in how data were analyzed. In this article, we use multiverse analysis to examine whether the findings reported in the original paper by Carney, Cuddy, and Yap are robust to plausible alternative data analytic specifications: outlier identification strategy, the specification of the dependent variable, and the use of control variables. Our findings indicate that the inferences regarding the presence and size of an effect on testosterone and cortisol are highly sensitive to data analytic specifications. We encourage researchers to routinely explore the influence of data analytic choices on statistical inferences and also encourage editors and reviewers to require explicit examinations of the influence of alternative data analytic specifications on the inferences that are drawn from data."
