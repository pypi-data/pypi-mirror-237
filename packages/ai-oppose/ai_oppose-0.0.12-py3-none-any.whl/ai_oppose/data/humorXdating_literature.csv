Sci.,2016,"Poor communication in teams has been found to result in disappointing team performance. Integrating research on team communication and laughter, we tested hypotheses about the relationship between working dyads’ patterns of laughter and their open communication and effectiveness. We examined two patterns of laughter: shared laughter occurs when both individuals laugh frequently in a dyad, and unshared laughter occurs when one individual in a dyad laughs frequently, but the other does not. Using data collected from 93 flight simulations in two aviation courses, we found that dyads engage in more open communication and are more effective when one member laughs frequently, but the other member does not. In addition, we found that the agreeableness of a dyad member reduces team effectiveness by increasing the likelihood of shared laughter. These results highlight the important role of laughter in team interactions and expand the growing literature on the role of emotions in teams.",23430400,7,150,

Seventy women imagined being approached by a man using a flippant and flirtatious “pick-up” line, a direct complimentary line, or an innocuous line that masks his interest. His attractiveness varied too. They then considered him for long-term or short-term relationships. Matching a “good dad” hypothesis, they favored him for a long-term relationship if he used a direct or innocuous line instead of the flippant line, because the latter conveyed lower trustworthiness and intelligence. Matching a “good genes” hypothesis, they favored him for a short-term relationship if he was attractive instead of unattractive, regardless of his pick-up line, presumably because attractiveness signals heritable fitness. Limitations and theoretical implications are discussed.",1219546,15,45,21166329

Pasisz, Katherine Aumer",Personality & social psychology bulletin,2009,"Are people who are funny more attractive? Or does being attractive lead people to be seen as funnier? The answer may depend on the underlying evolutionary function of humor. While humor has been proposed to signal “good genes,” the authors propose that humor also functions to indicate interest in social relationships—in initiating new relationships and in monitoring existing ones. Consistent with this interest indicator model, across three studies both sexes were more likely to initiate humor and to respond more positively and consider the other person to be funny when initially attracted to that person. The findings support that humor dynamics— and not just humor displays—influence romantic chemistry for both men and women, suggesting that humor can ultimately function as a strategy to initiate and monitor social relationships.",165427358,102,45,19407005

This study examines whether principles of assortative mating – people's tendency to select partners similar to them – apply to dating apps, or whether the reduced cue environment used on these apps leads users to choose more heterogeneous partners. Young (age <28) Dutch participants ( N = 522) used a mock dating app in which potential partners were either White or non-White, relatively low or high educated, and possessed an ethnically Dutch or non-Dutch name. Results pointed to educational assortativity for higher-educated participants and indicated that profile pictures, rather than names, influenced the choice of a White target for participants with a Dutch family background. • Attractiveness is most important factor in partner choice on a dating app. • Users with Dutch ancestry are more likely to pick profiles of White users, but not profiles of users with a Dutch-sounding name. • Higher educated users are more likely to pick profiles mentioning a university. • Overall, we find some patterns of assortative mating on a dating app.",20857034,10,47,

The objective of the present work was to investigate the role of specific humor styles, i.e. affiliative, self-enhancing, aggressive, earthy, and self-defeating, with regard to (a) relationship quality among married and divorced people and (b) divorced versus married status. We compared men and women from 98 married and 48 divorced couples (total N = 292) who evaluated their humor styles, anxiety and avoidance in attachment, marital satisfaction, and (ex-)spouse’s humor styles. Constructive humor (self-enhancing and/or affiliative), especially among men, was related to increased relationship satisfaction and to non-divorced status. Self-defeating humor, especially among women, predicted marital satisfaction but also divorce. Use of antisocial humor (aggressive and earthy), especially by men, predicted divorce and was related to low (retrospective) relationship quality among divorced couples. Humor styles were unique predictors of divorce beyond the impact of insecure attachment. Finally, partner similarity in the high or low use of self-defeating humor and the (transgressing social norms) earthy humor was observed in both the married and divorced, but the latter were dissimilar in the high or low use of humor styles implying positive or negative quality in interpersonal relations.

Psychol.,2018,"The present study introduces eight comic styles (i.e., fun, humor, nonsense, wit, irony, satire, sarcasm, and cynicism) and examines the validity of a set of 48 marker items for their assessment, the Comic Style Markers (CSM). These styles were originally developed to describe literary work and are used here to describe individual differences. Study 1 examines whether the eight styles can be distinguished empirically, in self- and other-reports, and in two languages. In different samples of altogether more than 1500 adult participants, the CSM was developed and evaluated with respect to internal consistency, homogeneity, test–retest reliability, factorial validity, and construct and criterion validity. Internal consistency was sufficiently high, and the median test-retest reliability over a period of 1–2 weeks was 0.86 (N = 148). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses showed that the eight styles could be distinguished in both English- (N = 303) and German-speaking samples (N = 1018 and 368). Comparing self- and other-reports (N = 210) supported both convergent and discriminant validity. The intercorrelations among the eight scales ranged from close to zero (between humor and sarcasm/cynicism) to large and positive (between sarcasm and cynicism). Consequently, second-order factor analyses revealed either two bipolar factors (based on ipsative data) or three unipolar factors (based on normative data). Study 2 related the CSM to instruments measuring personality (N = 999), intelligence (N = 214), and character strengths (N = 252), showing that (a) wit was the only style correlated with (verbal) intelligence, (b) fun was related to indicators of vitality and extraversion, (c) humor was related to character strengths of the heart, and (d) comic styles related to mock/ridicule (i.e., sarcasm, cynicism, but also irony) correlated negatively with character strengths of the virtues temperance, transcendence, and humanity. By contrast, satire had a moral goodness that was lacking in sarcasm and cynicism. Most importantly, the two studies revealed that humor might be related to a variety of character strengths depending on the comic style utilized, and that more styles may be distinguished than has been done in the past. The CSM is recommended for future explorations and refinements of comic styles.",20882021,99,30,29403416

Effectiveness was defined as success in securing a phone number or agreeing to meet again. We tested to determine which type of line (direct, innocuous, or flippant) was rated as most effective when attractiveness and perceived promiscuity of the women were manipulated. We predicted that direct pick-up lines would be the most effective when trying to pick-up men for the purpose of dating. We also predicted that men would rate the pick-up lines used by women rated high on attractiveness and promiscuity as being more effective than the pick-up lines used by those rated low on both characteristics. Results indicate that direct pick-up lines are preferred over flippant or innocuous pick-up lines, with the innocuous being the least preferred. Further, regardless of the line that is used, once a woman has been viewed as attractive by men, she is rated positively. This study provides insight into the effectiveness of women's tactics for soliciting dating attention.",51492917,3,27,

Men report using more other-deprecating humor than women do, and the use of other-deprecating humor decreases with age for both sexes. In the second part of the study, each participant listened to tape recordings of opposite-sex people who were described as having different levels of status, and who produced different types of humor; then participants rated each person's attractiveness as a potential short-term and long-term mate.

Gender-based disparagement humor and target perceptions,"Ayesha Tabassum, Len Karakowsky",(missing journal),2022,"Purpose This paper aims to draw upon extant theory and research to delineate the fundamental factors that impact how women evaluate disparaging humor directed at them. The conceptual framework presented outlines the most fundamental organizational-, interpersonal- and individual-level factors that influence the accuracy of such evaluation. Design/methodology/approach This is a conceptual paper that offers both a review of extant humor and gender research and theory and the presentation of a theoretical model that classifies sources of influence on evaluations of sexist humor from the perspective of the target. Findings Organization-, interpersonal- and individual-level factors are identified as sources of influence on women’s perception and evaluation of sexist humor leveled at them. This classification identifies factors including organizational power dynamics, egalitarian norms, interpersonal trust, target self-esteem and feminist identity. Research limitations/implications This paper offers a conceptual framework to guide future studies in more systematically examining the sources of influence on female targets’ capacity to recognize when they are the “punchline” of sexist humor. Practical implications The conceptual model developed in this paper offers important implications for managers and leaders in organizations in assisting targets to recognize instances of sexist humor directed at them. The aim is to arm potential victims with the knowledge necessary to foster awareness of their treatment in the workplace and to improve the accuracy of evaluation of workplace attitudes that may often nurture a sense of approval or apathy regarding displays of sexist humor.

The 77 papers surpassing a conservative quality criterion generated seven emergent themes around humor and gender differences. In short, men score higher in the aggressive humor style (M > F), while no other gender differences were consistently reported in humor-related traits (M = F). In the prediction of negative outcomes (stress, loneliness, depression), differential effects for humor in both genders are reported, but not consistently (M ≠ F). Gender differences exist for the appreciation of sexual humor (M > F), even in mixed target stimuli, and hostile humor (both genders appreciate opposite gender target stimuli more). Gender differences are absent in nonsense and neutral humor (M = F). For humor production, three samples showed no gender differences (M = F), while three samples suggested men are funnier (M > F) and one that women are funnier (M < F). No studies reporting differences in humor comprehension were identified (M = F). For humor use and communication, gender differences were found across methods (M ≠ F), yet, they depend on the context (e.g., workplace) and may thus resemble gender roles rather than “natural differences”. Moreover, few studies provide hard data on actual humor use and communication in different domains. When exposed to humor stimuli, different neural responses of men and women in prefrontal cortex activations (or selected parts) were found (M ≠ F). Also, self-report data suggest that both genders value a sense of humor in their partner (M = F), yet women typically value the humor production abilities more than humor receptivity, while for men, the woman’s receptivity of their own humor is more important than a woman’s humor production abilities, in line with gender stereotypes (M ≠ F). To conclude, much progress has been achieved in the past 15 years to overcome methodological flaws in early works on humor and gender differences. Importantly, attention should be paid to disentangling actual gender differences from gender role expectations and gender stereotypes. Methodologically, designs need to be checked for potential bias (i.e. self-reports may accentuate roles and stereotypes) and more hard data is needed to substantiate claims from self-report studies.",3074463,29,87,

We examined gender differences in reported use of humor styles, the associations between reappraisal and humor styles, and whether gender moderated those associations. Participants ( N =250) were recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk and self-reported their dispositional use of reappraisal and four humor styles. Men reported greater use of aggressive humor compared to women. Dispositional use of reappraisal was positively associated with self-enhancing humor. In addition, reappraisal use was positively related to greater use of affiliative humor, and this association was stronger for men than women. For men, greater use of reappraisal was associated with greater use of self-defeating humor, but reappraisal was negatively associated with self-defeating humor for women. Findings extend insight from prior work and suggest that both reappraisal and specific ways of using humor draw on aspects of self-regulatory competence rooted in cognitive change abilities, and the patterns of association differ in interesting ways for men and women.",52713826,5,33,

Then we use event history techniques to analyze humor attempts and successes in six-person groups. Our results combine to suggest an image of joking as a status-related activity, with men, high participators, frequent interrupters, and those who are frequently interrupted all showing status-related patterns of humor use. We find substantial time dependence in humor use, in which humor may serve to form a status hierarchy early in a group's development and to dissipate task-related tension later in the discussion. We use these results, in conjunction with core insights on status and emotion from the group processes literature, to develop a new theory of humor use in task-oriented groups. The new theory generates predictions about the content of humor episodes, which we examine with additional data from our group discussions. Consistent with the theory, we find that a higher proportion of men's humor is differentiating, while a higher proportion of women's humor is cohesion-building. We find the same general pattern with our other status variable, participation.",223604689,209,81,

Computers in Human Behavior, 63, 738–746 and examined the effects of profile gender role congruence, physical attractiveness, and a person’s own gender stereotypical characteristics on romantic interest in young adults. Participants viewed online dating profiles that varied in physical attractiveness and adherence to gender role norms. Attractive and gender role incongruent profiles were preferred over average-looking and gender role congruent profiles, but the latter effect was driven by women. The difference in preference for attractive and average-looking profiles was greater for women than for men. Women’s preferences for incongruent profiles were associated with self-reported feminine traits, but preference for congruent profiles was associated with self-reported masculine traits. Study 2 ( N = 958, 50.6% male) removed the profile photos to provide a better test of the influence of gender role congruence. Study 1 results replicated: Incongruent profiles were preferred over congruent profiles, primarily for women, and women’s masculine and feminine traits were associated with preferences for congruent and incongruent profiles, respectively, supporting the idea that attraction is based on perceived similarities. Men’s preference for both congruent and incongruent profiles was related to holding feminine communal traits and egalitarian gender role beliefs. Women’s preference for gender role incongruent profiles was robust across three studies. There was no support for predictions from social role theory that people prefer gender role congruence.",68532309,11,56,

The present study aimed to investigate specific cognitive reappraisal strategies that individuals employ in humorous reappraisal of adverse events. In a sample of 95 participants, the use of cognitive reappraisal sub-strategies was assessed in a behavioural test in which participants were required to generate a series of humorous reappraisals of self-relevant, threatening events. These reappraisal sub-strategies (three positive reinterpretation strategies, three de-emphasising strategies) were then related to the habitual use of different kinds of humour as well as the broader DSM-5 personality trait domains and well-being in terms of depressive experiences, assessed by self-report questionnaires. While no robust relationships were found for reappraisal strategies based on de-emphasising, sub-strategies within the positive reinterpretation category showed specific and contrasting associations with the examined traits. Findings indicated that the ability to produce humour is only linked to a favourable pattern of reappraisal strategies when manifested in benign forms of humour. Specific relations also emerged for the broader personality traits. The study suggests that some characteristics that advance the use of benign humour also benefit adaptive emotion regulation. The opposite seems to be true for malicious, or ""dark"" humour.

Hauser, Farina Rühs",Frontiers in Psychology,2021,"A large number of studies suggest that humor is associated with mental well-being and effective as a means of coping. However, it is less well-understood which mechanisms are effective for this particular function of humor. The present study examines whether processes of change of perspective, which are often regarded as constitutive for humor, could be an effective coping-factor when facing unrequited love as a specific psychological burden. In a questionnaire study, N = 148 persons aged 18–65 years (w = 96) with actual or past experiences of unrequited love reported on their subjective burden due to this experience, their self-esteem and satisfaction with life, two scales for humor (Multidimensional Sense of Humor Scale: MSHS, and a self-constructed scale: Humorous Change of Perspective, HCOP) and a coping scale which measure change of perspective in the confrontation with goal blockages (Flexible Goal Adjustment, FGA). Results indicated that the burden of unrequited love [operationalized objectively as actuality of experience (dichotomous) or subjectively as burden experienced] and both indicators of well-being were negatively associated. Multiple regression analyses showed that humor was a significant moderator of this relationship in nearly all combinations of operationalizations of humor and indicators of well-being: Higher levels of humor are associated with better well-being even when the perceived burden was high. In addition, the study examined whether the coping effect of humor can be partly or mainly attributed to the individual's capacity to perspective change as captured by FGA. When including this scale as a covariate in the regression models, the moderation effect for MSHS did not persist; however, for HCOP the moderation effect remained unchanged: the moderator effect of humorous change of perspective proved to be independent of FGA. Taken together the results suggest that perspective-changing skills play a significant role in the coping effect of humor in dealing with psychological burdens. However, depending on which humor facet is measured, the entailed perspective change may or may not appear to go beyond what the individual's FGA can account for. This suggests that the coping effect caused by humorous change of perspective includes aspects that are also discussed for other coping resources as well as its own, humor-specific aspects. Potential avenues for future studies are discussed both with respect to the necessity for replication and extension of the present study and to the determination of other potential alleviativing effects of other facets of humor.",150849179,2,75,34248748

Second, they were instructed to: (a) view; (b) use positive humour; or (c) use negative humour, and then rate their reactions. Compared to negative humour, positive humour was more successful at down-regulating negative and up-regulating positive emotion.

Conventional wisdom and recent EP research suggest that “something is funny because it's true.” This perspective on humor rings especially true in Rock's routines. Much of Rock's riffs on sex and marriage ring true and hence funny with his audiences because he deftly evokes their awareness of evolved sex differences in human mating strategies. Popular culture such as Rock's comedy can provide a window into human nature. I illustrate the intersection of EP and popular culture by unpacking the evolutionary theory and empirical evidence underlying 22 verbatim bits on human mating from Rock's five HBO comedy specials.

In two social interaction experiments, we examined the association between humor and liking. The first study was a secondary analysis of data from a prior experiment (originally conducted for another purpose) in which unacquainted participants engaged in a selfdisclosure task and rated each other on various dimensions, including humor. In Experiment 2, unacquainted mixed-sex dyads participated in a series of either humorous or similar but non-humorous tasks. In both studies, humor was positively associated with liking and closeness; perceived reciprocal liking and enjoyment of the interaction mediated the association between humor and liking. Likewise, we found a positive association between liking and humor. Men and women did not differ in self-reported humor use. The findings suggest that humor is a mechanism used to establish connections with others across all relationships and for both sexes. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Humor—and the laughter accompanying it—is prevalent in people’s daily lives (Bainum, Lounsbury, & Pollio, 1984). Some have estimated that the typical person laughs an average of 18 times a day, with much of this laughter occurring in the presence of others(Martin & Kuiper, 1999). Humor undoubtedly affects social interactions and shapes people’s interpersonal bonds. Thus, it may be one of the many tools people have in their social arsenal to establish connections with others (Vettin & Todt, 2004). In this research, we examined whether humor and liking are mutually transformative. Specifically, we speculated that, on average, not only does humor promote liking, but liking also promotes humor and that both associations occur in the same interaction. Following this reasoning, we further suspect that people may like humorists via two mechanisms: the degree to which they believe that a humorist likes them (i.e., perceived reciprocal liking) and enjoyment of the interaction with the humorist. As described later, we focused on two types of liking: (i) platonic (friendship) liking between same- and opposite-sex persons and (ii) romantic desire between two opposite-sex persons.",113268685,64,40,

The present study addresses this question by investigating spontaneous laughter produced during a 5-min conversation in a heterosexual speed-dating experiment.

Moreover, high-attraction dates were expected to converge toward the same laughter type. The results of the experiment demonstrate that (a) laughs are particularly frequent in the first minute of the conversation, (b) daters who are mutually attracted show a significantly larger degree of temporal overlap in laughs, (c) specific laughter types (classified as a nasal “laugh-snort”) prevail in high-attraction dates, though shared laughs are not consistently of the same type.

Men and women (N = 700) indicated their preferences for several attributes in either a casual sex partner, dating partner, marriage partner, same-sex friend, or opposite-sex friend (randomly assigned). Participants also indicated how important it was to obtain a partner with the desired level of each attribute. Although participants most preferred warmth and kindness, expressivity and openness, and a good sense of humor across relationship types, they clearly distinguished between romantic/sexual relationships and friendships. Specifically, participants preferred (and felt that it was more important to obtain) higher levels of many desirable characteristics - including physical attractiveness, social status attributes, and disposition or personality traits (e.g., warmth, expressiveness, humor, intelligence) - in a romantic/sexual partner than in a friend. Participants also differentiated between same-sex and opposite-sex friend- ships. In general, they preferred higher levels of and/or believed it was more important to obtain physical attractive- ness, social status, and dispositional/personality attributes from opposite-sex friends than from same-sex friends. To at least some degree, men's preferences were associated with the number of others they believed were available for a particular type of relationship; women's preferences generally were associated with perceptions of their own desirability as a partner.",172891188,269,38,
(missing DOI),Made you laugh: the interpretation of interactive laughter within friendships,Michelle M. Matter,(missing journal),2019,"Although past scholars have studied laughter as a form of communication, prior research 
is scarce on how laughter is perceived by interactants. This mixed methods study deepens 
scholarly understandings of laughter as both a communicative act and a form of affection by 
investigating how friends in dyadic interactions make meaning of the laughter they share during 
those interactions. Pairs of friends were video-recorded having a short, light-hearted 
conversation. Following the conversation, each individual watched the video, explaining at each 
instance of laughter what they were feeling and why they believed laughter occurred at that point 
in the conversation. Data from both interactants was then compared to examine the types of 
laughter that were manifested in conversations as well as patterns regarding participants 
perceptions and communication of laughter. In general, previous laughter categories were 
supported by the data, but new categories were also identified, including laughing out of 
relatability (show understanding), lighten (decrease stress or negative feelings), memory
(remember the situation being discussed), reactionary (because the other person laughed first), 
anticipation (expecting something funny to happen), cue (indicate that the other person should laugh), common joke (previously shared and recognized humor), mental image (picturing the 
event or story), and endearing (out of love) laughter. A new categorization system is proposed 
which assesses laughter in terms of its relational effects along the spectrums of prosocialantisocial and basic-complex; in particular, prosocial laughter is examined as an affectionate 
behavior according to the definitions from Floyds Affection Exchange Theory. This study 
offers a deeper understanding of laughter as a crucial yet understudied form of nonverbal 
communication by highlighting the relational meanings and implications of laughter among 
friends.",159544647,0,43,

Humor, a uniquely human trait, evolved as a means of facilitating rapport between individuals and fostering stronger interpersonal bonds through the elicitation of positive affect and activation of reward centers in the brain. We predicted that those experiencing acute ostracism would rate others’ attempts at humor (i.e., jokes) as funnier than those experiencing social inclusion, particularly low-quality jokes, as a means of ingratiating themselves to new opportunities for affiliation. Men and women were either included or ostracized via Cyberball and rated male and female targets’ funniness and likeability, half of which were paired with a funny joke and the other half an unfunny joke. Excluded men rated women as funnier than did included men, even when women’s jokes were categorically unfunny.

There is little doubt that evolutionary forces played an important role in shaping humor, but the nature of humor adaptation is still debated. Sexual selection theory is presumed to play a central role in the evolution of humor, and growing evidence supports this view. Humor plays an important role in mate choice, and because of the asymmetry in reproduction costs for males and females, humor production and appreciation should be sexually dimorphic. Predictions based on sexual selection theory are largely met. Data show that humor production ability is more important for women when selecting a mate, while men want a woman that will appreciate and laugh at their humor. Studies on conversational humor and personal dating ads show that men try to advertise their humor creativity, while women evaluate men’s humor. Men also tend to initiate more humor, especially when other women are around, while women smile and laugh more overall and particularly when men are present. In addition, studies show that men are better, on average, than women at producing high-quality spontaneous humor and are generally more motivated to present their humor production ability. Producing a great sense of humor translates into mating success, and men are more likely to benefit from such high-quality humor ability. Humor production is also correlated with intelligence, especially verbal intelligence, and is partially heritable, lending support that humor serves as a mental fitness indicator.",182190082,33,133,

The goal of the present research was to determine whether this gender difference can be explained by differences in beliefs about one’s capability for humor (“humor self-efficacy”). Male and female U.S. undergraduates (n = 64) generated captions for 20 cartoons and rated their own humor self-efficacy. Subsequently, an independent sample of 370 Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) users evaluated these captions in a knockout-style tournament in which pairs of captions were presented with each of the cartoons. Each participant was randomly assigned to evaluate captions which were authored by men and women selected to be either low or high in humor self-efficacy. In the initial round of the tournament, each caption was authored by a man and a woman matched for comparable levels of self-identified humor self-efficacy. In subsequent rounds, the remaining captions were paired randomly. MTurk users, unaware of the captioners’ gender, selected the captions of men as funnier only under the low self-efficacy condition and those of women as funnier under the high self-efficacy condition. These data suggest that self-efficacy may be a critical determinant of the successful performance of humor. When people say that women are not funny, they may be relying on an unfounded stereotype.

Nine preregistered experiments (N = 5400) test this proposition by targeting, specifically, the use of humor.

10.1515/HUMR.1997.10.1.77,On the role of humor appreciation in interpersonal attraction: It’s no joking matter,"A. Cann, L. Calhoun, J. Banks",(missing journal),1997,"The belief that another person shares your appreciation for humor is likely to exert a powerful effect on interpersonal attraction because sense of humor is a highly valued quality in others, and an important personal characteristic. In an attitude similarity-interpersonal attraction laboratory experiment, participants were led to believe an unseen stranger had manyf or very few, similar attitudes. In addition, participants were allowed to interact, via an intercom, with the stranger, in order to relate a favorite joke. The stranger responded positively or neutrally to the joke. Although both attitude similarity and response to the joke influenced ratings of interpersonal attraction in the expected direction, the positive response to the joke was sufficiently powerful to overcome attitude dissimilarity. A dissimilar stranger who responded positively to the joke was more attractive than a similar stranger who responded neutrally. The results are interpreted äs indicating that some dimensions of similarity are more important than others, and that humor appreciation may be an especially critical dimension. We are attracted to those others whose views we believe are similar to our own. From the early observations of Aristotle (1932), to the Undings of current social psychological research (Smeaton, Byrne, and Murnen 1989), this has been a consistent theme, and a robust relationship (Byrne et al. 1971). Although the similarity-attraction relationship has been extended to personality (Caspi and Harbener 1990; Thelen, Fishbein, and Tatten 1985) and physical appearance (Feingold 1990) similarity, the primary focus, and most consistent results, have involved similarity of attitudes and beliefs.

Banks The underlying process assumed to be driving the similarity-attraction relationship is the reinforcement (positive affect) that results either from believing another supports your views (Byrne and Clore 1970), or, possibly, from the expectation that one who agrees with you will like you (Condon and Crano 1988), creating a mutually satisfying reciprocal relationship. As the proportion of similar attitudes increases, positive affect increases, and attraction grows (Byrne and Nelson 1965). The only limiting factor is that the similarity of attitudes and beliefs must be recognized if it is to positively affect attraction. Thus, it is the perception of similarity, not the reality, that determines the expressed degree of attraction (Byrne and Blaylock 1963). The particular attitudes or beliefs that are believed to be similar, or dissimilar, would be expected to impact on the level of attraction. Agreement or disagreement on personally important topics should produce a stronger reinforcement and a more powerful affective response. Results from surveys of naturally occurring friendship pairs (Kandel 1978; HUI and Stull 1987) support this proposal. Some beliefs, those judged äs more relevant to the individual, seemed to better predict the reported levels of friendship and the stability of the friendship relationship. It follows that receiving Information implying perceived similarity on a dimension judged äs important to seif and äs valuable in interpersonal interactions could dramatically affect ratings of interpersonal attraction. Despite the logic of this argument, little attention has been paid to this possibility in the similarity-attraction literature. An early investigation, using the highly controlled ""attraction to a stranger"" procedure found no effect for issue importance (Byrne and Nelson 1964). Attraction changed äs the proportion of similar attitudes changed, regardless of the level of importance. While subsequent studies did find an ""importance"" effect, so long äs important and unimportant issues could be compared (Clore and Baldridge 1968), specific issues that might be expected to affect attraction have not been examined. The present study examined this possibility through an indirect manipulation of perceived similarity of humor appreciation. The question is whether a person would be attracted to a stranger simply because the stranger laughed at the person's rendition of a joke, regardless of the level of agreement on other issues. Humor appreciation was selected äs the dimension of similarity because it is a part of having a sense of humor, which appears to be a generally recognized highly valued characOn the role ofhumor appreciation in interpersonal attraction 79 teristic of seif and of others. For example, in rating one's own sense of humor, individuals tend to have highly inflated views of their position relative to others. In two different samples, over 90 percent of respondents claimed to have average to above average senses ofhumor (Allport 1961; Lefcourt and Martin 1986). Given that so few individuals are wüling to admit to having a below average sense ofhumor, this must be a characteristic closely tied to positive definitions of seif. Humor appreciation has been considered a component of multidimensional definitions of sense of humor (Sveback 1974; Thorson and Powell 1993a), and has emerged äs a factor in recent attempts to validate a sense of humor scale (Thorson and Powell 1993a, 1993b). Sense of humor also has been shown to be a highly desirable quality in others, at least in heterosexual relationships. Murstein and Brust (1985) had students in dating relationships rate a series of humorous Stimuli, and rate their attraction to their partner. They found that similarity in humor ratings was associated with higher levels of loving, liking, and predisposition to marry. More recently, Buss (1988) conducted a series of studies to identify effective behaviors for attracting members of the opposite sex. College students were asked to rate a large set of behaviors thought to be relevant to ""courting"" success. From these ratings, Buss generated lists of the ""20 most effective male acts"" and the ""20 most effective female acts"" for attracting the opposite sex. For both males and for females, the act that was at the top of the list, the most effective act for both groups, was ""displaying a good sense of humor"". Obviously, sense of humor, äs a personal quality, is potentially very important, and perceived similarity of humor appreciation, äs it implies a good sense of humor, could dramatically affect perceptions of interpersonal attraction. In the present study, perceptions ofhumor appreciation similarity were manipulated in same-sex pairs, and the impact of this perceived humor similarity was compared to similarity on other attitudinal dimensions. If humor appreciation similarity is of no particular importance in interpersonal attraction, discovering similarity, or dissimilarity, should only minimally affect attraction. The proportion of perceived similar attitudes would be altered only slightly. Alternatively, if humor appreciation is a highly valued factor, then discovering similarity should significantly alter ratings of attraction. Participants will ""discover"" that they share many similar or few similar attitudes with a ""stranger"". The participants will then conduct a controlled interaction with the ""stranger"" during which they learn that the 80 A. Cann, L. G. Calhoun, and J. S. Banks ""stranger"" shares or does not share their appreciation of humor. Given the assumed potency of humor appreciation äs an interpersonal variable, it is predicted that perceived agreement on humor will negate the negative effects of disagreement on other attitudinal issues. Thus, attraction should be greatest when other attitudes and humor are all similar, slightly lower when humor similarity is present, despite attitudinal dissimilarity, and still lower when humor similarity is not confirmed, but other attitudes are similar. Attraction would be lowest when neither source of similarity is strong.",95317243,83,21,

Over a period of three weeks, undergraduate students (N = 136) completed seven online questionnaires that assessed their relationship satisfaction and dissatisfaction and their use of humor styles with their dating partners over the previous three days. This study represents a departure from previous cross-sectional designs that focus on between-person correlations. Results from the within-person level (i.e., changes within individuals over time), as well as the between-persons level are reported. For some humor styles, within-person findings mirrored between-person findings. For example, affiliative humor use at both levels was positively associated with relationship satisfaction. However, other humor styles revealed different effects at the two levels of analysis. For instance, aggressive humor was negatively associated with relationship satisfaction at the between- but not the within-persons level. A significant cross-level interaction was also found. A strong negative association between daily self-defeating humor and relationship satisfaction was found only for individuals who used high levels of this humor style overall. In contrast, no within-person association was found for those who rarely used this type of humor.",128415244,41,29,

In each study a negative-life-events checklist was used to predict stress scores on a measure of mood disturbance. These studies made use of different measures of subjects' sense of humor, including four selfreport scales and two behavioral assessments of subjects' ability to produce humor under nonstressful and mildly stressful conditions. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed that five of the six humor measures produced a significant moderating effect on the relation between negative life events and mood disturbance. Subjects with low humor scores obtained higher correlations between these two variables than did those with high humor scores. These results provide initial evidence for the stress-buffering role of humor. The notion that humor possesses therapeutic properties has long enjoyed popular support. This idea can be traced at least as far back as the ancient biblical maxim that ""a merry heart doeth good like a medicine"" (Proverbs 17:22), and it has gained recent support from the account of Norman Cousins's (1979) recovery from a serious collagen disea.se through massive doses of laughter and vitamin C.

This study aimed to analyze whether styles of humor and social skills correlate, and also the relation that links these variables according to gender. We employed the Humor Styles Questionnaire (HSQ) and the Social Skills Scale (EHS, in Spanish) to assess 643 participants. The results showed that males used styles of humor (Affiliative, Self-enhancing, Aggressive and Self-defeating) more than females. We found gender differences for social skills only in the factors Expression of disapproval (higher scores for females) and Say no and interrupt interactions (higher scores for males). The data indicate correlations among the factors styles of humor and social skills, but not in them all. When we formed groups that allowed the classification of participants according to styles of humor and social skills, females showed a more even distribution, while three of every four males obtained high levels for styles of humor (except for Self-defeating humor) and social skills (except for Making requests). The model created with styles of humor and social skills indicated an optimum fit: χ2(25) = 56.921 p < 0.001; χ2/gl =2.27; CFI = 0.97; NFI = 0.94; TLI = 0.94; RMSEA = 0.044, 95%CI (0.029–0.060), with minor gender differences in the relation between styles of humor and social skills. In conclusion, this research shows how males scored higher than females for all four humor styles and dimensions, and not only for negative humor styles as in previous research works. We found that gender differences for social skills revealed only two factors, which may be related to the use of negative humor styles (Expression of disapproval and Say no and interrupt interactions). Finally, one in every three males and two in every three females had problems in some, or several, sections to manage styles of humor and social skills.

We used a round-robin design where participants (N = 66) engaged in 10 different conversations with 10 same-gender strangers and counted the instances of laughter for each person in each conversation. After each conversation, participants rated their perceived similarity with their partner and how much they enjoyed the conversation. More than half the variability in the amount a person laughed was attributable to the person laughing-some people tend to laugh more than others. By contrast, less than 5% of the variability was attributable to the laugher's partner. We also found that the more a person laughed, the more their partners felt similar to them. Counterintuitively, laughter negatively predicted conversation enjoyment. These findings suggest that, in conversations between strangers, laughter may not be a straightforward signal of amusement, but rather a social tool.

However, the effect of humorous reappraisal on later memory about the emotion-eliciting situation is currently unknown, although this is crucial for more adaptive responding in future situations. To address this issue, we examined the effects of humorous reappraisal on both emotional experience and memory, compared to non-humorous rational reappraisal and a non-reappraisal control condition. Replicating previous findings, humorous reappraisal reduced evoked negative valence and arousal levels very effectively, and the down-regulation of experienced negative emotions was even more pronounced after humorous compared to rational reappraisal. Regarding later memory for emotion-eliciting stimuli, both humorous and rational reappraisal reduced free recall, but recognition memory was unaffected, with memory strength being stronger after humorous than after rational reappraisal. These results indicate that humor seems to be indeed an optimal strategy to cope with negative situations because humor can help us to feel better when confronted with negative stimuli, but still allows us to retrieve stimulus information later when afforded to do so by the presence of appropriate contextual features.",52441105,30,28,26379608

Humor displays as a male mating strategy appear context-dependent, which suggests that women's preferences for certain humor may be contingent on their mating goals. One dimension of humor variability that could approximate men's long- (LTM) or short-term (STM) mating goals is communication of humor that is categorically clean or dirty, respectively, which could influence the humorists' desirability to women. Such displays may differentially signal sexual receptivity. Two studies tasked women with indicating interest in men who generated either clean or dirty humor. Across both studies clean humor producers were preferred when evaluating both the long- and short-term desirability of men, although this preference was larger for LTM evaluations. Study 2 also demonstrated that sociosexually unrestricted women (i.e., those with more permissive sexual attitudes) self-reported greater behavioral attraction toward dirty humorists, a preference mediated by their perceptions of dirty jokes as funnier. Dirty humor production in men and appreciation in women may facilitate respective STM goals.

Wilson",The Quarterly Review of Biology,2005,"A number of recent hypotheses have attempted to explain the ultimate evolutionary origins of laughter and humor. However, most of these have lacked breadth in their evolutionary frameworks while neglecting the empirical existence of two distinct types of laughter—Duchenne and non‐Duchenne—and the implications of this distinction for the evolution of laughter as a signal. Most of these hypotheses have also been proposed in relative isolation of each other and remain disjointed from the relevant empirical literature. Here we attempt to remedy these shortcomings through a synthesis of previous laughter and humor research followed by (i) a reevaluation of this research in light of theory and data from several relevant disciplines, and (ii) the proposal of a synthetic evolutionary framework that takes into account phylogeny and history as well as proximate mechanisms and adaptive significance. We consider laughter to have been a preadaptation that was gradually elaborated and co‐opted through both biological and cultural evolution. We hypothesize that Duchenne laughter became fully ritualized in early hominids between 4 and 2 mya as a medium for playful emotional contagion. This mechanism would have coupled the emotions of small hominid groups and promoted resource‐building social play during the fleeting periods of safety and satiation that characterized early bipedal life. We further postulate that a generalized class of nonserious social incongruity would have been a reliable indicator of such safe times and thereby came to be a potent distal elicitor of laughter and playful emotion. This class of stimuli had its origins in primate social play and was the foundation for formal human humor. Within this framework, Duchenne laughter and protohumor were well established in the hominid biobehavioral repertoire when more cognitively sophisticated traits evolved in the hominid line between 2 mya and the present. The prior existence of laughter and humor allowed them to be co‐opted for numerous novel functions, and it is from this process that non‐Duchenne laughter and the “dark side” of laughter emerged. This perspective organizes the diversified forms and functions that characterize laughter and humor today and clarifies when and how laughter and humor evolved during the course of human evolution.",7810990,492,177,16519138

The former describes a humorous outlook on life that entails the realistic observations and understanding of human weaknesses (and the imperfection of the world) but also their benevolent humorous treatment. By contrast, corrective humor involves moral-based ridicule—that is, the use of mockery to fight badness and mediocrity. Corrective humor, akin to satire, uses wit to ridicule vices, follies, abuses, and shortcomings with the intent of shaming individuals and groups into improvement. Participants (N = 340) filled in statements assessing the two virtue-related humor concepts, general sense of humor (subsample of n = 144), mockery, and 24 character strengths. As expected, benevolent humor showed positive correlations with most of the 24 character strengths and uniquely related to the strengths of several virtues (justice, temperance, and transcendence) beyond general sense of humor. Corrective humor related most strongly to strengths of the virtues wisdom, courage, and justice, especially once mockery was controlled for. Thus, both constructs capture important virtue-related humor aspects over and above the sense of humor and mockery and are thus suitable for—at least partially—filling the “virtue gap” in humor research. They have the potential to pave the way for developing and investigating further humor constructs that meaningfully relate to strengths and virtues.

10.1007/S11031-015-9524-8,Understanding the effects of exposure to humor expressing affiliative and aggressive motivations,"Arnie Cann, Adam T. Cann, Jennifer A. Jordan",Motivation and Emotion,2016,"Using humor, being funny, and having a good sense of humor are often reported as desirable qualities. However, little attention has been paid to possible differences in responses to humor reflecting affiliative as opposed to aggressive motivations. In evaluating a stranger, when examples of affiliative and aggressive humor were presented as the stranger’s preferred humor, aggressive humor led to more negative impressions (Study 1). To further explore the impact of humor reflecting affiliative versus aggressive motivations, participants were exposed to equally funny videotapes representing the two humor styles (Study 2). Women’s reported affective experiences varied across the humor styles, but men’s did not. Women and men rated the affiliative video as being more positive than negative, but no differences in the qualities were found for the aggressive video. Results across the two studies demonstrate the importance of considering not just the funniness of humor efforts, but also the social motives conveyed by the humor. Given the complexity of responses to humor, additional research is needed to better understand the contexts within which being funny might have social benefits versus social costs.",158147531,23,40,

Brand, Abigail Bonatsos, Rebecca D'Orazio, Hilary L. DeShong",Computers in Human Behavior,2012,"Attractive people are considered by others to have many positive qualities and in the case of social skills and intelligence, these attributions are often true. In internet dating, individuals with attractive profile photos are viewed more favorably overall, but no research has yet established whether they indeed have more positive qualities. We addressed this issue by having 50 women independently rate 100 photos and free-written texts taken from males' profiles on a popular dating website. Photos rated as physically attractive had profile texts that were rated as more attractive, even though photos and texts were rated by different judges. Perceived confidence seemed to play a mediating role, suggesting that attractive men write appealing texts because they are aware of their high mate value. Thus, contrary to popular belief, the internet does not seem to ''level the playing field.''",85577119,45,31,

Christenfeld",Psychonomic Bulletin & Review,2012,"It has often been asserted, by both men and women, that men are funnier. We explored two possible explanations for such a view, first testing whether men, when instructed to be as funny as possible, write funnier cartoon captions than do women, and second examining whether there is a tendency to falsely remember funny things as having been produced by men. A total of 32 participants, half from each gender, wrote captions for 20 cartoons. Raters then indicated the humor success of these captions. Raters of both genders found the captions written by males funnier, though this preference was significantly stronger among the male raters. In the second experiment, male and female participants were presented with the funniest and least funny captions from the first experiment, along with the caption author's gender. On a memory test, both females and males disproportionately misattributed the humorous captions to males and the nonhumorous captions to females. Men might think men are funnier because they actually find them so, but though women rated the captions written by males slightly higher, our data suggest that they may regard men as funnier more because they falsely attribute funny things to them.",22090505,44,19,
