# mewbot-dev-tools

Tools to aid with mewbot development.

## Purpose

While developing mewbot we built a number of tools to assist with development.
This mostly consist of tool chains for
 - running the linters
 - building dev venvs (still forthcoming)
 - building the docs (still forthcoming)
 - gather and run the tests

The aim of these tools is that, if you run them on a code base, you should
end up with something which conforms to mewbot's guidelines.
