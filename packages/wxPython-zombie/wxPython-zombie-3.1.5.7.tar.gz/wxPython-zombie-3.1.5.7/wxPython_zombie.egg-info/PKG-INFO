**wxPython-zombie** eventually matured to version 3.1.5 of wxWidgets. No more
development, only bug fixes are done, a lot so far. **wxPython-zombie** will
provide the 64-bit binary extension package (build with Visual Studio 2022) for
MS Windows 10/11 and the source package to build for Linux. This is a release for
Python 3.12.

**wxPython-zombie** is forked from commit `64e5d86`__ of wxPython Project Phoenix
on 30 Jan 2021. The included wxWidgets is from the on 14 Apr 2021 released
`wxWidgets 3.1.5`__ . The latest version of the meta build system Waf is used,
released on 12 Aug 2023, `waf 2.0.26`__. Also the latest version of, a Python
bindings generator for C/C++ libraries, SIP is used, released on 14 Oct 2023,
`sip 6.7.12`__. The source distribution format that is now used, is specified
in `PEP 517`__. The binary distribution format (wheel) that is used, is specified
in `PEP 427`__. The Windows wheel was built with `Build Tools for Visual Studio
2022`__, configured for the *Windows SDK (10.0.22000) for Windows 11* and
the *MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ x64/x86 build tools*.

You must not install **wxPython** and **wxPython-zombie** in the same environment,
both packages use the package directory ``wx``.

The build and installation on Linux was tested on Arch Linux, with just the
minimal explicit installed packages or groups linux, base, base-devel, webkit2gtk,
glu, sdl2 and pyenv. With pyenv, Python 3.12.0 was installed and used. The build
will take about 15 to 40 minutes, depending on your system. To see the verbose
progress of the build process, use the verbose option in pip. Warning: the verbose
option in pip < 21.2 can produce a lot of output in the beginning when pip is
creating a build environment. On Linux, update pip first before building and
installing **wxPython-zombie**, as normal user::

    $ python -m pip install -U pip

The demo package of **wxPython-zombie** is included in the distribution.
