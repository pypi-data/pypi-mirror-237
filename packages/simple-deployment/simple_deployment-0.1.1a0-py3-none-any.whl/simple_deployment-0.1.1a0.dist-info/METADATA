# Chatbot Interface with Flask and Hugging Face Transformers

## Description

This project is a chatbot interface that integrates Hugging Face's Transformers library with a Flask backend. It serves a frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to interact with the user. The user can input text which is then processed by the Flask backend and fed into a pre-trained language model. The model's generated text is then sent back to the frontend and displayed.

## Folder Structure

- `frontend/`: Contains all frontend HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
  - `index.html`: Main HTML file that provides the user interface.
  
- `backend/`: Contains Flask application and related backend code.
  - `app.py`: Main Flask application script.
  
- `models/`: Folder where pre-trained language models are saved.
  
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all Python dependencies.

## How to Use

### Prerequisites

1. Python 3.x
2. pip

### Installation

1. Clone the repository.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-link.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

   ```
   cd Chatbot-Interface
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages.

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Start the Flask application.

   ```
   python backend/app.py
   ```

2. Open a web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

3. Use the frontend interface to interact with the chatbot. You can choose a pre-trained model from the dropdown or upload your own.

### Interacting with the Chatbot

1. Type your text into the input field and press "Send" or hit the Enter key.
2. The chatbot's response will appear below your message.
