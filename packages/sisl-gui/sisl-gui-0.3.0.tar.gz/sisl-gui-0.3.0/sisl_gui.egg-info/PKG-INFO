Description: This is the graphical interface that you can use to interact with [sisl's](https://github.com/zerothi/sisl) visualization module.
        
        It consists of two parts:
        - [Back-end](sisl_gui): A `Session` class, which stores and manipulates the state of the application. This app can then be connected
        to the frontend in multiple ways. Currently, it is possible to use the `Session` directly in the browser (thanks to pyodide) or connect
        it to the frontend via sockets (implemented as a `flask` app that uses `flask-socketio`).
        - [Front-end](frontend): A javascript/typescript UI, which is developed using [React](https://reactjs.org/). The build is shipped with
        the python module and it is also available at https://pfebrer.github.io/sisl-gui/.
