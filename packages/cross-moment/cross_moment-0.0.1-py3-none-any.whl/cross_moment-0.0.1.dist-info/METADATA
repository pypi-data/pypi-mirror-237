## Getting started
To reproduce the experiments from the work "A Cross-Moment Approach for Causal Effect Estimation", please run the ```main.ipynb``` jupyter notebook. The necessary packages for the experiments are specified in the ```requirements.txt```.

An implementation of Cross-Moment method can be found in ```methods.py```. Cross-Moment method is implemented by function ```compute_beta```. Moreover, function ```get_beta_sensor_fusion``` performs Cross-Moment method having two proxies.
