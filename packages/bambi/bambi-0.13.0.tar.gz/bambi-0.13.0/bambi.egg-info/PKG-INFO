BAyesian Model-Building Interface in Python

## Overview

Bambi is a high-level Bayesian model-building interface written in Python. It's built on top of the [PyMC](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc) probabilistic programming framework, and is designed to make it extremely easy to fit mixed-effects models common in social sciences settings using a Bayesian approach.

## Installation

Bambi requires a working Python interpreter (3.9+). We recommend installing Python and key numerical libraries using the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads), which has one-click installers available on all major platforms.

Assuming a standard Python environment is installed on your machine (including pip), Bambi itself can be installed in one line using pip:

    pip install bambi

Alternatively, if you want the bleeding edge version of the package you can install from GitHub:

    pip install git+https://github.com/bambinos/bambi.git

### Dependencies

Bambi requires working versions of ArviZ, formulae, NumPy, pandas and PyMC. Dependencies are listed in `pyproject.toml` and should all be installed by the Bambi installer; no further action should be required.

## Example

In the following two examples we assume the following basic setup

```python
import bambi as bmb
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

data = pd.DataFrame({
    "y": np.random.normal(size=50),
    "g": np.random.choice(["Yes", "No"], size=50),
    "x1": np.random.normal(size=50),
    "x2": np.random.normal(size=50)
})
```

### Linear regression

```python
model = bmb.Model("y ~ x1 + x2", data)
fitted = model.fit()
```

In the first line we create and build a Bambi `Model`. The second line tells the sampler to start
running and it returns an `InferenceData` object, which can be passed to several ArviZ functions
such as `az.summary()` to get a summary of the parameters distribution and sample diagnostics or
 `az.plot_trace()` to visualize them.


### Logistic regression

Here we just add the `family` argument set to `"bernoulli"` to tell Bambi we are modelling a binary
response. By default, it uses a logit link. We can also use some syntax sugar to specify which event
we want to model. We just say `g['Yes']` and Bambi will understand we want to model the probability
of a `"Yes"` response. But this notation is not mandatory. If we use `"g ~ x1 + x2"`, Bambi will
pick one of the events to model and will inform us which one it picked.


```python
model = bmb.Model("g['Yes'] ~ x1 + x2", data, family="bernoulli")
fitted = model.fit()
```
