# Colour Workbench

This project can be used as a environment for
[colour-developers](github.com/colour-science/colour) or for people interested
in developing and exploring colour-science in general. 

This workbench template installs colour-science, colour-datasets, and
colour-specio into your python environment with are contain useful color
algorithms, data, and spectrometer controls respectively.


## Installation

To use this repository you need to install python poetry to manage the
development environment. Poetry can be installed by following the documentation
[here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)


After installing `poetry` open a terminal into the project directory and run
`poetry install`. THen open the project folder in vscode.

In visual studio code make sure to select the correct python environment and
finally you can start experimenting. A good entry point is to look at the
[README](colour_workbench/ETC/README.ipynb) in the ETD Display Evaluation folder
and then start your own notebooks in the [notebooks](notebooks) folder. 

## Test Pattern Generator

There is a test pattern generator project that may be useful in combination with
this project, details can be found on (its github page)[https://github.com/tjdcs/ETC_TestPatterns].
