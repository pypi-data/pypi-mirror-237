# Pynequa
A python library to handle communication with Sinequa REST API.

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pynequa/badge/?version=latest)](https://pynequa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)
![Build](https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/pynequa/actions/workflows/pkg_build_check.yml/badge.svg)

> Sinequa is an enterprise search tool. It provides a cognitive search and analytics platform that helps organizations gain insights from their structured and unstructured data spread across various sources, including databases, documents, emails, websites, and more.

## Installation

```
   $ pip install pynequa
```

## Example Usage
```
import pynequa
from pynequa.models import QueryParams

# provide following config parameters
config = {
   "base_url": "",
   "app_name": "",
   "access_token":"",
   "query_name": ""
}

# initialize a Sinequa connector instance
sinequa=pynequa.Sinequa.from_config(config)

# OR
# you can directly instantiate Sinequa using
sinequa = pynequa.Sinequa(
     access_token: config["access_token"],
     base_url: config["base_url"],
     app_name: config["app_name"],
     query_name: config["query_name"],
)

params = QueryParams()
params.search_text = "<your_search_text>"
# other params

# perform a search query operation
results=sinequa.search_query(params)
```
