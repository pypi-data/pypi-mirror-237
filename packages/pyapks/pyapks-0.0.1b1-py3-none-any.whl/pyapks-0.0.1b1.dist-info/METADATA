## Usage üì¶

-   `package_name`: Specifies the package name of the application you want to download.
-   `file_name`: Specifies the name of the downloaded APK file.
-   `version`: Specifies the version you want to download (e.g., you can use "latest" to get the latest version).
-   `in_background`: Specifies whether the download process will run in the background.
-   `limit`: Determines the depth of the search when searching for an application. (The more it is, the slower it becomes.)
### Using ApkPure üåê
To download an APK file using the ApkPure class, you can use the following example:

    from pyapks.apkpure import ApkPure
    Downloader = ApkPure()
    Downloader.download_by_package_name(package_name="com.whatsapp", file_name="Whatsapp", version="latest", app_ext="xapk", in_background=False)
-   `package_name`: Specifies the package name of the application you want to download.
-   `file_name`: Specifies the name of the downloaded APK file.
-   `version`: Specifies the version you want to download (e.g., you can use "latest" to get the latest version).
