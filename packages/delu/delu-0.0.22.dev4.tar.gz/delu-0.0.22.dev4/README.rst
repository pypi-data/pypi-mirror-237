DeLU (Deep Learning Utilities)
==============================

`Documentation <https://yura52.github.io/delu>`_

.. __INCLUDE_0__

**DeLU is a simple well-documented PyTorch toolbox** consisting of the following parts:

- **Extensions**: extensions to existing PyTorch submodules
  (``delu.nn`` ~ ``torch.nn``, ``delu.random`` ~ ``torch.random``, etc.).
- **Tools** (``delu.tools``): handy tools for common scenarios
  (e.g. for implementing training loops).
- **Tabular** (``delu.tabular``): tools for working on tabular data problems.

**Project status** ðŸ§ª
*Until the release of v0.1.0, DeLU should be considered as experimental.
So far, breaking changes have been rather minor, but they can happen.
All changes are carefully documented in the GitHub releases.*

Installation
------------

Without ``delu.tabular`` (only the "Extensions" and "Tools" parts):

.. code-block:: none

    pip install delu

With ``delu.tabular``
(must be imported separately; recommended: ``import delu.tabular as tab``):

.. code-block:: none

    pip install delu[tabular]

Usage
-----

*DeLU is a toolbox, not a framework,
so you can learn things and start using them in any order.*

The API documentation (the left sidebar on the website)
is the main source of knowledge about DeLU:
it provides usage examples, explanation and docstrings.
