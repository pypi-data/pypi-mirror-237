OmicScope: OmicScope: from quantitative proteomics to systems biology.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

*OmicScope* is a comprehensive workflow designed to analyze and provide insights on quantitative proteomics data. To date, *OmicScope* works with data generated from `Progenesis QI for Proteomics <https://www.nonlinear.com/progenesis/qi-for-proteomics/>`__, `MaxQuant <https://www.maxquant.org/>`__, `PatternLab V <http://www.patternlabforproteomics.org/>`__, and DIA-NN. Additionally, a fourth generic input can be used, enabling users to run *OmicScope* with data from different platforms, such as transcriptomics. For users that previously performed statistical analysis, OmicScope provides the Snapshot method to quickly import data.

*OmicScope* can perform differential expression analysis in both static and longitudinal experimental designs. For static experiments, proteins that are differentially regulated are determined by t-tests (for 2 group comparison) or One-way ANOVA (for >2 group comparison); while for longitudinal analysis, *OmicScope* performs the pipeline suggested by Storey, 2005.

Once the differential expression data is obtained, the user can perform Over-Representation Analysis (ORA) or Gene-Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), which are implemented according to `GSEApy <https://gseapy.readthedocs.io/>`__ in the EnrichmentScope module.

Both differential expression and enrichment analyses have a comprehensive visualization toolkit generated by *OmicScope*, including dotplots, networks, heatmaps, etc.

Finally, for each experiment performed by *OmicScope*, it is possible to export an omics file (.omics extension) for further use in the **Nebula workflow**. Nebula is a specialized module that enables analysis of multiple studies or comparisons, providing several types of analysis to compare those groups and find similarities among them.
