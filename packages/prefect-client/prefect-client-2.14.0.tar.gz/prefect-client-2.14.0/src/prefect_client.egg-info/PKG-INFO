Description: # Overview
        
        This directory contains files for building and publishing the `prefect-client` 
        library. `prefect-client` is built by removing source code from `prefect` and 
        packages its own `requirements.txt` and `setup.py`. This process can happen 
        in one of three ways:
        
        - automatically whenever a PR is created (see 
        `.github/workflows/prefect-client.yaml`)
        - automatically whenever a Github release is published (see 
        `.github/workflows/prefect-client-publish.yaml`)
        - manually by running the `client/build_client.sh` script locally
        
        Note that whenever a Github release is published the `prefect-client` will 
        not only get built but will also be distributed to PyPI. `prefect-client` 
        releases will have the same versioning as `prefect` - only the package names 
        will be different.
        
        This directory also includes a "minimal" flow that is used for smoke 
        tests to ensure that the built `prefect-client` is functional.
        
        In general, these builds, smoke tests, and publish steps should be transparent. 
        It these automated steps fail, use the `client/build_client.sh` script to run 
        the build and smoke test locally and interate on a fix. The failures will likely 
        be from:
        
        - including a new dependency that is not installed in `prefect-client`
        - re-arranging or adding files in such a way that a necessary file is rm'd at 
          build time
