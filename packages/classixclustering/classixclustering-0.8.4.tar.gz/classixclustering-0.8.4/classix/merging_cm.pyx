        Sort values.

    radius : float
        The tolerance to control the aggregation. If the distance between the starting point 
        of a group and another data point is less than or equal to the tolerance,
        the point is allocated to that group. For details, we refer users to [1].

    minPts : int, default=0
        The threshold, in the range of [0, infity] to determine the noise degree.
        When assgin it 0, algorithm won't check noises.

    scale : float, default 1.5
        Design for distance-clustering, when distance between the two starting points 
        associated with two distinct groups smaller than scale*radius, then the two groups merge.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : numpy.ndarray
        The input that is array-like of shape (n_samples,).
    
    splist : numpy.ndarray
        List of starting points formed in the aggregation.

        the point is allocated to that group. For details, we refer users to [1].

    method : str, default='distance'
        Method for group merging, Available options are:
        
        - 'density': two groups are merged if the density of data points in their intersection 
           is at least as high the smaller density of both groups. This option uses the disjoint 
           set structure to speedup agglomerate.
           
        - 'distance': two groups are merged if the distance of their starting points is at 
           most scale*radius (the parameter above). This option uses the disjoint 
           set structure to speedup agglomerate.
    
    scale : float
        Design for distance-clustering, when distance between the two starting points
