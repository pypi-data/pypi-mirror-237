Description: # Jina Python SDK (AWS SageMaker)
        
        This package offers streamlined tools for interacting with [Jina Embedding Models through the AWS SageMaker Marketplace](), all within a Python environment.
        
        ## Installation
        
        The package can be installed with pip:
        ```bash
        pip install --upgrade jina-sagemaker
        ```
        
        Install from source:
        ```bash
        python setup.py install

        ## Quick Start
        
        Before you can take advantage of this library, it's essential to configure your AWS credentials. You can accomplish this by running the `aws configure` command. Once your credentials are in place, the [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina-sagemaker/blob/main/notebooks/Inference%20with%20Jina%20Embedding%20Model.ipynb) will guide you through the initial setup and usage.
