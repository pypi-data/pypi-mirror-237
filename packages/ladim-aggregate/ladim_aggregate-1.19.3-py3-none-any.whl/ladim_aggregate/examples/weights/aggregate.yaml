# Use a weighting variable, or import weighting from file

# In this example, we use a simple 1-dimensional binning
bins:
  X: [0, 50, 100]

# Here we specify the weights expression. This must be a valid numeric
# expression containing variable names defined in the input file.
# Variables imported from external files can also be used in the expression.
# In the expression below, `spec` and `super` are imported from a file
weights: mass * spec * super

# The standard name "histogram" may not make sense when the weights are
# applied. Here, we change the name to "conc"
output_varname: conc

# Import grid variables from a netCDF file.
# - Grid variables are sampled by bilinear interpolation for each particle instance
# - Grid does not have to match the grid used when creating the ladim input file
# - Grid coordinate names must match variable names in the ladim input file
grid:
  - file: external.nc
    variable: spec
  - file: external.nc
    variable: super

# Output file
outfile: count.nc

# Input file
infile: ladim.nc
