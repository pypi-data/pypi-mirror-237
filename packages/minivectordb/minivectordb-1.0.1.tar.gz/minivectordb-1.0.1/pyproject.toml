description = "A python project aimed at extracting embeddings from textual data and performing semantic search. It's a simple yet powerful system combining a small quantized ONNX model with FAISS indexing for fast similarity search. As the model is small and also running in ONNX runtime with quantization, we get lightning fast speed."
