## Version 0.0.5 (Latest) 
**Released:** October 26, 2023<br />
**Tag:** v0.0.5

### Enhancements

- Removed two methods from the "normalization" module:
  - `remove_leading_trailing_spaces`: This method was used to remove leading and trailing spaces in the input text. (Method removed in this release)
  - `replace_multiple_spaces`: This method was used to convert consecutive double spaces into single spaces in the input text. (Method removed in this release)

- Added a new method to the "normalization" module:
  - `remove_whitespace(text)`: This new method efficiently removes all excess spaces in the input text. It replaces consecutive sequences of spaces with a single space and removes any leading or trailing spaces, ensuring a cleaner and more consistent text output.

<br /><br />

## Version 0.0.4 
**Released:** May 4, 2023<br />
**Tag:** v0.0.4

### Enhancements

- The code to handle exceptions and errors has been refactored to reduce code duplication across modules. In addition, the changes will make adding and testing errors or exceptions easier to maintain in the future.


### Bug Fix

- Fixed a number of inconsistent return statements (R1710) within the package modules. This ensures that all functions will return a consistent expression when called.

<br /><br />

## Version 0.0.3
**Released:** May 2, 2023<br />
**Tag:** v0.0.3

### Bug Fix

- Fixed a bug contained within the modules that was causing a Cyclic Import issue (R0401). One of the import statements was missing a period at the start of the module name. The fix has been tested and deployed successfully.

<br /><br />

## Version 0.0.2 
**Released:** May 1, 2023<br />
**Tag:** v0.0.2

### General Changes

- Added Module Docstrings


### Bug Fix

- Fixed an unidiomatic-typecheck (C0123) from type() to isinstance(). The idiomatic way to perform an explicit typecheck in Python is to use isinstance(x, y) rather than type(x) == Y.

<br /><br />
