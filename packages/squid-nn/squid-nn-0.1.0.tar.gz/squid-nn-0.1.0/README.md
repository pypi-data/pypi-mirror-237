## SQUID Repository
This repository contains the software implementation for our [paper](https://www.google.com) **Title** (Seitz, McCandlish, Kinney and Koo). It contains tools to apply the discussed method **SQUID** (**S**urrogate **Qu**antitative **I**nterpretability for **D**eepnets) on genomic models.

SQUID is a TensorFlow package to interpret sequence-based deep learning models for regulatory genomics data with domain-specific surrogate models.

### Install:

```bash
pip install squid
```

### Dependencies:

```bash
conda create -n squid python=3
pip install mavenn
pip install mavenn --upgrade
pip install pyyaml
```

Note: for older versions of Tensorflow, ... #to be done


### Usage:
SQUID provides a simple interface that takes as input a deep-learning model. For any deep-learning model that takes in sequence as input, perform SQUID as follows:

```python
import squid

#to be done
```

The `run_squid.py` script contains code for running SQUID on several example deep-learning models.
