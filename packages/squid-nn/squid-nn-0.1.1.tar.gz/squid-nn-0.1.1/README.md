**SQUID** (**S**urrogate **Qu**antitative **I**nterpretability for **D**eepnets) is a TensorFlow package to interpret sequence-based deep learning models for regulatory genomics data with domain-specific surrogate models. For installation instructions, tutorials, and documentation, please refer to the SQUID website, https://squid-nn.readthedocs.io/. For an extended discussion of this approach and its applications, please refer to our manuscript:

### Install:

```bash
pip install squid-nn
```

### Dependencies:

```bash
conda create -n squid python=3
pip install logomaker
pip install mavenn
pip install mavenn --upgrade
```

Note: For older DNNs that require inference via Tensorflow 1, Python < 3 is required which is not supported by MAVE-NN. Users will need to create separate environments in this case:
1. An environment with Tensorflow 1 and Python 2 for generating *in silico* MAVE data
2. An environment with Tensorflow 2 and Python 3 for training MAVE-NN surrogate models


### Usage:
SQUID provides a simple interface that takes as input a sequence-based deep-learning model (e.g., a DNN), which is used as an oracle to generate an *in silico* MAVE dataset representing a localized region of sequence space. The MAVE dataset can then be fit using a domain-specific surrogate model, with the resulting parameters visualized to reveal the biological mechanisms driving model performance.

- Examples in Python: 

	- The script `run_squid.py` contains code for running SQUID on several example deep-learning models
	- The `squid_manuscript` repository contains examples for applying SQUID on several other DNNs such as ENFORMER, and includes additional options for scalability: https://github.com/evanseitz/squid_manuscript

	- Additive analysis with DeepSTARR: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/12HR8Vu_8ji3Ac1wli4wgqx1J0YB73JF_?usp=sharing

	- Pairwise analysis with ResidualBind-32: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1eKC78YE2l49mQFOlnA9Xr1Y9IO121Va5?usp=sharing
