  # Description: Class attribute is shadowing a Python builtin

  # Description: Dynamically typed expressions (typing.Any) are disallowed
  # Rationale:
  #  The library is meant to operate on many dynamic objects.
  #  When it is possible, use object instead of Any when typing only-input values
  #  whose extra (to the object class) methods are not used.

  #  Too complex functions very often are unimprovable without sacrificing readability.
