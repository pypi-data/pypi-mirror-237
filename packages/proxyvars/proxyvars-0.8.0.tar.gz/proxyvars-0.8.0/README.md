## proxyvars `v0.6.1`
Python library for creating object proxies with ease. As for now, the documentation is mostly in the codebase (check relevant docstrings of `proxy()`, `const_proxy()`, `lookup_proxy()`, `proxy_field_accessor()`, `proxy_item_accessor()` and `proxy_attribute_accessor()` for more information).
