## Function Objects

For a detailed description of function objects, their usage, use cases and relevant examples, please see the this [section](https://github.com/lulav/citros_cli#adding-functions-to-parameter-setup) in the main README.md file of the citros-cli repository.

As a demonstration of the usage of user-defined functions, an example file named `my_func.py` is provided, which includes the function `my_awesome_func`, which is pretty awesome.
