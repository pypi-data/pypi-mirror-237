# alpha and l1_ratio are both float-type values to control the balance between L1 and L2 norm.
# The weight of L1-norm used in ElasticNet is equal to alpha * l1_ratio. 
# The weight of L2-norm used in ElasticNet is 1/2 * alpha * (1 - l1_ratio). 
# For more details, refer to https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.ElasticNet.html
