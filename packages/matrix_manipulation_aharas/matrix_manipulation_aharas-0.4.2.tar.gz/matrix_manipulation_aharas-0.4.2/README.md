### Changelog
 - removed an if condition from transpose2d, it was unnecessary
 - added wraps to decorators to preserve the attributes, annotations and docstrings

## Project Overview
A POC Python library that should help the data scientists to do data transformations, mainly focused on matrix transformations. The functions in the library are developed with vanilla python, but can work with Numpy arrays as well.

## Prerequisites
Project makes use of numpy and Python 3.10.
To start the process one needs to install dependencies listed in requirements.txt
Package can be install via `pip3 install matrix_manipulation_aharas==0.4.2`

## Project Structure

Project consists of:
1.`helpers` - file containing required functions
2.`decorators` - decorators used fo validation of incoming data (matrix)
3. `classes` - an additional file with custom Matrix class. Main purpose was to practice inheritance, variance, static typing and goose typing.
4. `tests` - various test of functions

## Test
To run the test execute `python3 -m tests.test` in `matrix-manipulation-aharas` folder.
