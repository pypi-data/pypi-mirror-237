MDBASE
------

MDBASE joins and processes data from multiple XLSX databases.

* The XLSX databases:
    - MS Excel files with similar structure.
    - Similar structure = the same columns names.
* The joining of databases:
    - The databases are auto-joined into one pandas.DataFrame object.
* The processing of joined databases:
	- Correlations: statistical plots + correlation coefficients and p-values.
	- Comparisons: boxplots + statistical significance of different groups.
* Example of usage and more details:
	- *Polymers*, submitted (revisions requested).
	- If you use MCREEP in your research, **please cite** the publication above.
