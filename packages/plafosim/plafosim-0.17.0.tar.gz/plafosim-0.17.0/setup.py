Buse and Falko Dressler, "Scalable Simulation of Platoon Formation Maneuvers with PlaFoSim," Proceedings of 13th IEEE Vehicular Networking Conference (VNC 2021), Poster Session, Virtual Conference, November 2021, pp. 137–138.\n\n**NOTE**: PlaFoSim is (still) under heavy development.\n\n---\n\n## Installation\n\n- Install Python (>=3.7,<=3.9)\n- Install PlaFoSim from [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/plafosim/):\n```pip install plafosim```\n\n**NOTE**: The project is developed and currently only tested on Linux.\n\n## Running a Simulation\n\n**NOTE**: Since PlaFoSim is a command-line interface (CLI) application, running PlaFoSim requires using a shell.\n\n### Quickstart\n\nUse PlaFoSim\'s help to get a list of available parameters:\n\n```plafosim -h, --help```\n\nOr, run a simulation with the default configuration (`-d`):\n\n```plafosim -d```\n\n### Live GUI\n\nYou can visualize the simulation via a simple live GUI based on [SUMO](https://github.com/eclipse/sumo/), using the argument `gui` (requires installation of SUMO and decleration of `SUMO_HOME` variable):\n\n```plafosim --gui```\n\n![](docs/gui.png)\n*A screenshot of PlaFoSim\'s live GUI showing 2 platoons and various individual vehicles. Copyright © 2021 IEEE.*\n\nMore options for the live GUI can be found within the ``GUI properties`` section of the help.\n\n**NOTE**: This requires installation of SUMO (>=1.6.0) and declaration of the `SUMO_HOME` variable.\n\n### Advanced Simulation Control\n\nYou can use a variety of different parameters to customize the scenario and the simulation itself.\nE.g., use the parameter `vehicles` to configure the number of vehicles in the simulation:\n\n```plafosim --vehicles 1000```\n\nThe available parameters are grouped into different categories:\n\n```\n- road network properties\n- vehicle properties\n- trip properties\n- communication properties\n- platoon properties\n- formation properties\n- infrastructure properties\n- simulation properties\n- GUI properties\n- result recording properties\n```\n\nYou can find a list of available parameters for each category in the help:\n\n```plafosim -h, --help```\n\n#### Examples\n\n```\n# Configure a 100km freeway with ramps at every 10km\nplafosim --road-length 100 --ramp-interval 10\n\n# Configure random (normally distributed) desired driving speed of 130km/h\nplafosim --random-desired-speed true --desired-speed 36\n\n# Configure random trips for 500 vehicles\nplafosim --vehicles 500 --random-depart-position true --random-arrival-position true --depart-desired true\n\n# Pre fill the freeway with 1000 vehicles\nplafosim --vehicles 1000 --pre-fill true\n\n# Configure 50% of the vehicles with Advanced Cruise Control (ACC) and a headway time of 1.5s\nplafosim --penetration 0.5 --acc-headway-time 1.5\n\n# Enable a simple, distributed platoon formation algorithm [1] in order to form platoons every 30s\nplafosim --formation-algorithm SpeedPosition --formation-strategy distributed --execution-interval 30\n```\n\n### Faster Simulation\n\nYou can speed up the simulation performance by enabling Python\'s optimization ```PYTHONOPTIMIZE```, e.g., in order to disable assertions:\n\n```PYTHONOPTIMIZE=1 plafosim```\n\nSee the Python [documention](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONOPTIMIZE) for more details.\n\n## Re-Playing a Simulation\n\nThe simulation can write a trace file including the mobility details of every simulated vehicle (default `results_vehicle_traces.csv`).\nYou can replay the simulation in the GUI (see above) based on the trace file by using the corresponding binary:\n\n```plafosim-replay results_vehicle_traces.csv```\n\nTo see all options of this script, run:\n\n```plafosim-replay -h, --help```\n\n## Extending PlaFoSim\n\nIn order to extend PlaFoSim, you first need ot install it from source.\n\n- Install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/):\n```pip install poetry```\n- Clone this repository:\n```git clone https://github.com/heinovski/plafosim.git```\n- Navigate to newly created directory of the cloned repository in the command-line\n- Install PlaFoSim from source in editable mode:\n```poetry install```\n- Run PlaFoSim in the virtual environment:\n```poetry run plafosim```\nYou can also activate the virtual enviroment first with ```poetry shell``` and run the commands as usual (see above).\n\n### Adding a new Formation Algorithm\n\nIn order to add a new formation algorithm, you need to follow these steps:\n- Create a new sub-class of `FormationAlgorithm` (see `formation_algorithm.py`). You can use the `Dummy` algorithm (see `algorithms/dummy.py`) as an example.\n- Import your algorithm and add its `__name__` to the list of available algorithms (see `--formation-algorithm`) within `cli/plafosim.py`.\n- Add specific properties of your algorithm via an argument parser group and a corresponding help message to `cli/plafosim.py` if necessary.\n- Import your algorithm in `PlatooningVehicle` (see `platooning_vehicle.py`) and/or `Infrastructure` (see `infrastructure.py`).\n\nYou should now be able to use your new algorithm with\n```\nplafosim --formation-algorithm dummy_algorithm_name\n```\n\n## Contributing to the Project\n\nIn order to contribute, please follow these steps:\n- Install PlaFoSim from source (see Extending)\n- Make desired changes\n- Run the tests located in `tests` as well as the validation scripts located in `scripts` (see `.drone.yml` for details)\n- Submit a Pull Request (PR)\n\n### Testing\n\nWhen adding methods and functions, make sure to add corresponding unit tests for `py.test`.\nThe tests are located under `tests` and can be executed with `./scripts/run-pytest.sh`.\nThis will also generate a test coverage report.\n\n### Validation\n\nTo validate the behavior of PlaFoSim, it is compared to SUMO 1.6.0 by means of simulation results (e.g., vehicle traces).\nThe corresponding scripts are located under `scripts` and executed withn CI/CD pipelines.\nYou can have a look at `.drone.yml` for details regarding the execution.\n\n### Profiling\n\nYou can profile the runtime of PlaFoSim\'s code by using [cProfile](https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html#module-cProfile):\n\n```poetry run python -m cProfile -o profile.out -m plafosim.cli.plafosim```\n\nYou can visualize the results of the profiling run by using [SnakeViz](https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html#module-cProfile):\n\n```snakeviz profile.out```\n\n## Contributors & Citing\n\nPlaFoSim was originally designed and built by [Julian Heinovski](https://github.com/heinovski/) with the help of [Dominik S.
