H2O Driverless AI (DAI) is a high-performance, GPU-enabled, client-server application for the rapid development and deployment of state-of-the-art predictive analytics models. It reads tabular data from various sources and automates data visualization, expert level automatic feature engineering, model validation (overfitting and leakage prevention), model parameter tuning, model interpretability and model deployment. H2O Driverless AI is currently targeting common regression, binomial classification, and multinomial classification applications including loss-given-default, probability of default, customer churn, campaign response, fraud detection, anti-money-laundering, and predictive asset maintenance models. It also handles time-series problems for individual or grouped time-series such as weekly sales predictions per store, with time-causal feature engineering and validation schemes.
