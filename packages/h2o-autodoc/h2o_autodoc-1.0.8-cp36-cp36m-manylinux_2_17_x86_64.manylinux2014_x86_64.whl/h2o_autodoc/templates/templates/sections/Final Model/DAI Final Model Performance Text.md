3. Final Model Selection

After the final iteration, the best performing final model is trained on a final set of engineered features. Depending on the initial experiment settings the final model can be a single model or an ensemble of models; a stacked ensemble can consist of different base models or a bagged ensemble (pasting) of the same model type.

**Performance**

Problem-type specific metrics and charts are provided once a Driverless AI experiment is completed. For example, in a binary classification experiment summary a model developer can review the AUC, AUCPR, and F1 Score among other metrics, as well as experiment graphs like the ROC plot and the Lift and Gain Charts.

The performance of the Final Model is shown below, where the **Optimized** metric is indicated with an X.
