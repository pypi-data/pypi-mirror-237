The final selected model was developed using the Driverless AI software.  Driverless AI trains models to access the performance of using different algorithms with different parameters and features (see **Models for Optimization Summary**). As a result, the final model is only selected after verifying that alternative models do not perform better, based on the model developer’s specified evaluation metric.

The goal of this experiment is to determine which optimized model will generate the {{ scorer_direction }} **{{experiment.score_f_name}}** for predicting the model’s target, named *{{params._params.target_col}}*.
