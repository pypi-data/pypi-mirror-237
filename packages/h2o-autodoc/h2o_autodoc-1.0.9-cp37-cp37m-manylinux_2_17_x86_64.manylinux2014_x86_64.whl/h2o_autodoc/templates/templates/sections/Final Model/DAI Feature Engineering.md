Driverless AI employs a series of Feature Engineering Transformers to generate new features.  It determines the effectiveness of the features generated by evaluating how it effects model performance on a validation dataset.

Based on the experiment settings and column types in the dataset, Driverless AI was able to explore the following transformers:

{% for key, value in feature_evolution._feature_transformers_available.items() %}

- **{{key}}**: {{value}}

{% endfor %}

The Driverless AI experiment automatically created {{"{:,}".format(final_features.get_num_transformed_features_survived())}} new features and selected {{"{:,}".format(final_features.get_num_transformed_features_used())}} of them to be used in the final model.  The table below shows a portion of the variables considered over the experimentâ€™s **{{experiment_overview._iteration_info.actual_num_iterations}}** iterations.  

{{feature_evolution.get_top_features_iterations(config.autodoc_num_features)}}
