In this experiment Driverless AI tried {{"{:,.0f}".format(alternative_models._num_alternative_models)}} alternate models, and {{"{:,}".format(final_features. get_num_transformed_features_survived())}} features. From all these models, Driverless AI chose the model that performed the best according to the model developer’s selected performance metric.

**Multiple Hypothesis Problem**

Driverless AI uses a variant of the reusable holdout technique to address the multiple hypothesis problem. For more information on this topic refer to: Dwork, Cynthia et al. “The reusable holdout: Preserving validity in adaptive data analysis.” Science 349 (2015): 636-638.
