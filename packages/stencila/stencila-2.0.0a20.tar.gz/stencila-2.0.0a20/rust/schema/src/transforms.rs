//! Functions for transforming nodes between types
//!
//! These functions implement transformations for `Vec` and other types
//! where, due to Rust's "orphan rule", we can not implement the `From`
//! trait. If possible, prefer to implement `From`, or `Into` in the `implem/*.rs`
//! file for the type, rather than add another function here.
