    Parameters
    ----------
    cpi: constant or a timeseries
    ts: the timeseries on which we wish to evaluate the cpi values
    gap: the gap (in months) between successive cpi indexes values
    
    For most cpi indices, index is published every month.
    
    august cpi is published in september and that return materializes over october to november
    interestingly, this future growth is KNOWN so potentially, future back adjusted calculation is possible
    
    For Australia, months = 3

    and the usual tenor, coupon, freq defining the cash flows,
    can we determine the pv of an ilb and its derivative wrt both yld and cpi_yld
    

    :Present Value calculation:
    --------------------------
    
    There are n = freq * tenor periods
    and a period discount factor, i.e.   

    d = (1 + yld/freq) [so that paying a coupon of y/freq at end of period, would keep value constant at 1]

    On the other hand, there is growth factor g = (1 + cpi_yld/freq) since we get paid based on growth of cpi

    g = (1+cpi_yld/freq)

    Let f = g / d

    and let r = 1/(1-f)

    notional_pv = f^n
    
    if yld == cpi_yld and f == 1 then...
    pv = 1 + c * n # n coupons + notional
    
    :duration calculation:

    we denote p = cpi_yld
    df/dy = - 1/freq * g/d^2 = - f^2 / (freq * g)
    df/dp = = 1/(freq * d) = f / (freq * g)
