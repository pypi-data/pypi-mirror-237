    Given yield and cash flows (coupon, tenor and freq), we calculate pv and duration.

    :Present Value calculation:
    --------------------------
    
    There are n = freq * tenor periods
    and a period discount factor f is (1 + y/freq) i.e.   
    f = 1/(1 + y/freq) [so that paying a coupon of y/freq at end of period, would keep value constant at 1]
    r = 1/(1-f)
    so...
    
    coupons_pv = c f + c * f^2 + ... c * f ^ (freq * tenor)  = c * f * (1+f...+f^(n-1)) = c * f * (1 - f^n) / (1 - f)  = c * f * (1-f^n) * r
    notional_pv = f^n
    
    if yld == 0 and df == 1 then...
    pv = 1 + c * n # n coupons + notional
    
    :Duration calculation:
    --------------------------

    dr/dy = r^2 df/dy
    
    - dnotional/dy =  n f ^ (n-1) df/dy

    dcoupon_dy/c = df/dy ( 1 + 2f + 3 f^2 ... + nf^(n-1)) 
                 = 1/freq * (1 + 2 +... n) ## since f = 1
