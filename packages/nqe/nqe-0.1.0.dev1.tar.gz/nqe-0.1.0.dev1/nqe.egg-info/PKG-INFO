# Neural Quantile Estimation

Simulation-Based Inference with Quantile Regression.

## Installation

To install, clone this repo and run

```
pip install -e .
```

We are yet to have the first release of NQE.
While already available on pypi, it is likely some not-up-to-date dev version,
so please directly build from GitHub for now.

## Documentation

Coming soon, please check back later.
