# iblatlas
This repository contains tools to manipulate 3D representations of the mouse brain anatomy for electrophysiolgy experiments.
The tools are mainly using the the Allen Brain Atlas although some other atlases can be used and are written in Python.

One of the requirment of this repository is to use minimal requirements, based of standard matplotlib, numpy and scipy libraries, and excludes visualisation tool.
