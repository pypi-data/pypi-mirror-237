## Location

Materials are stored in the `./manuals` directory. Each material is a .md or a .py file.

## Writing Materials

When you need to write a material based on a conversation so far, extract key information from this conversation in very consise form. The goal is for you to read those instructions later, and be able to do this faster next time.
