AI Console is an AI-powered personal assistant designed to help you with a wide range of tasks. It combines the power of artificial intelligence and natural language processing to provide personalized assistance and streamline your workflows.

## Features 

Task Management: AI Console can help you manage your tasks and projects efficiently. It can create, update, and track your to-do lists, set reminders, and provide helpful prompts to keep you on track.

Programming Assistance: Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, AI Console can assist you in coding tasks. It can generate code snippets, fix common programming errors, and provide recommendations for improving your code.

Content Creation: Need help with content creation? AI Console has got you covered. It can generate engaging blog post ideas, suggest catchy headlines, and even assist in crafting compelling introductions. With its imaginative voice and storytelling techniques, AI Console can elevate your content creation efforts.

Data Retrieval: Say goodbye to tedious manual data retrieval tasks. AI Console can fetch data from various sources, such as APIs, databases, and web scraping. It can organize and analyze the retrieved data, and present it in a format that suits your needs.



## Installing & Running

```shell
pip install --upgrade aiconsole --pre # (in some environments it must be pip3 instead of pip)
mkdir your_project_dir
cd your_project_dir
export OPENAI_API_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
aiconsole
```
On a Mac you might be prompted to install developer tools in order to install aiconsole.

If during installation you get errors like:

```
WARNING: The script aiconsole is installed in '/Users/user/Library/Python/3.9/bin' which is not on PATH.
Consider adding this directory to PATH or, if you prefer to suppress this warning, use --no-warn-script-location.
```

Run aiconsole like this: `/Users/user/Library/Python/3.9/bin/aiconsole` (replace the path with a path that you see in the warnings) instead of `aiconsole`.

In your project directory, aiconsole will create a bunch of working files like standard materials and agents

## Running Your AIConsole Dev Mode

In order to run your own AIConsole:

1. Install poetry`pip install poetry`, update PATH if needed.
1. Clone the project.
2. In the main project folder `aiconsole` run: `poetry install`.
3. In the `aiconsole/web`: run yarn`.
4. In `aiconsole` run: `poetry run aiconsole-dev`.

Requires OPENAI_API_KEY env variable to be set.

### Running in another directory in dev mode

Often times you want to host aiconsole working files in another directory, even while developing. In order to do that you need to:

1. Discover the path to your env:
poetry env info

2. You will get something like: /Users/user/Library/Caches/pypoetry/virtualenvs/aiconsole-rmLpd4fO-py3.10

3. Execute in your directory of choice the following command:

```shell
vepath/bin/python -m aiconsole.init
```

so in our example that would be:

```shell
/Users/user/Library/Caches/pypoetry/virtualenvs/aiconsole-rmLpd4fO-py3.10bin/python -m aiconsole.init
```

## Publishing process

```shell
cd web && npm run build && cd .. && poetry build && poetry publish --username __token__ --password ...
```

## Materials

Create .md files in ./materials directory in the following format:


```md
<!---
Description of when this material should be used?
-->

# Title of the material

Actual content of a material
```

Files are monitored and automatically loaded, then used as context. You can keep there API manuals, login information, prompts and other contextual information.

You can see examples of materials in the ./preset/materials directory
