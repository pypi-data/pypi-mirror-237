Click [here](https://sensirion.com/products/catalog/SHT30-DIS-B) to learn more about the Sensirion SHT3X sensor family.


Not all sensors of this driver family support all measurements.
In case a measurement is not supported by all sensors, the products that
support it are listed in the API description.



## Supported sensor types

| Sensor name   | IÂ²C Addresses  |
| ------------- | -------------- |
|[SHT30A](https://sensirion.com/products/catalog/SHT30A-DIS-B)| **0x44**, 0x45|
|[SHT30](https://sensirion.com/products/catalog/SHT30-DIS-B)| **0x44**, 0x45|
|[SHT31A](https://sensirion.com/products/catalog/SHT31A-DIS-B)| **0x44**, 0x45|
|[SHT31](https://sensirion.com/products/catalog/SHT31-DIS-B)| **0x44**, 0x45|
|[SHT33](https://sensirion.com/products/catalog/SHT33-DIS)| **0x44**, 0x45|
|[SHT35A](https://sensirion.com/products/catalog/SHT35A-DIS-B)| **0x44**, 0x45|
|[SHT35](https://sensirion.com/products/catalog/SHT35-DIS-B)| **0x44**, 0x45|

The following instructions and examples use a *SHT30*.



## Connect the sensor

You can connect your sensor over a [SEK-SensorBridge](https://developer.sensirion.com/sensirion-products/sek-sensorbridge/).
For special setups you find the sensor pinout in the section below.
