methane, from biomass:
  - production of 2 wt-% potassium iodide solution
  - biomethane production, from biogas upgrading, using amine scrubbing
  - biomethane, gaseous, 5 bar, from sewage sludge fermentation, at fuelling station
methane, synthetic:
  - methane, from electrochemical methanation, with carbon from atmospheric carbon dioxide capture
  - methane, from biological methanation, with carbon from atmospheric carbon dioxide capture
