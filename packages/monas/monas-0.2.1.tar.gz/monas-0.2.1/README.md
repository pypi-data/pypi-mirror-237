## About this project

**Monas** is a tool to manage multiple Python projects in a single repository, or the so called ["Monorepo"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo).
It is mainly inspired by [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/). In a monorepo, some dependencies are shared across packages while others are different. When you change the code of one of these shared dependencies, you may want to run the test suite across all dependant packages. Monas makes the workflow easier.
