[![CI Build](https://github.com/rstudio/gt-python/workflows/CI%20Tests/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/rstudio/gt-python/actions?query=workflow%3A%22CI+Tests%22+branch%3Amain)

With the **gt** package, anyone can make wonderful-looking tables with Python. The **gt** philosophy: we can construct a wide variety of useful tables with a cohesive set of table parts. These include the *table header*, the *stub*, the *column labels* and *spanner column labels*, the *table body*, and the *table footer*.

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install gt
```
