## Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html) (if using local models on GPU)

If using Windows and trying to run locally, it is unsupported, but you will need [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) and [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) at a minimum in addition to the above.

### Download and Install

Open a terminal and run the following to download and install ESA:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/experian-sales-advisor/ESA
cd ESA
./ESA.sh
```

### Environment Setup

You can choose to skip the environment setup and accept default values by entering `Y` on the first question `Quick Setup without advanced configuration? (Y for yes, N for No)`.

If you chose `N`, see the [Environment Variable Setup](https://experian-sales-advisor.github.io/ESA/1-Getting%20started/1-Environment%20Variables.html) documentation for guidance on setup.

### Install Options

You will be prompted to choose an install option. Choose Option 1 to build docker images built and taged "latest" version. Choose 4 to build docker images built and tagged with the "main" branch in Github.

### Running and Updating ESA

Any time you want to run or update ESA, run the following commands from your `ESA` directory:

```bash
./ESA.sh
```

- Access the ESA Next.js Admin Web Interface at http://localhost:24498
- Access the Agent Admin Streamlit Web Interface at http://localhost:8501
- Access the ESA API documentation at http://localhost:7437

If you're running with the option `Run ESA and Text Generation Web UI with Docker (NVIDIA Only)`, you can access the Text Generation Web UI at http://localhost:7860/?__theme=dark to download and and configure your models. The `AI_PROVIDER_URI` will be `http://text-generation-webui:5000` for your ESA agents.

## Configuration

Each ESA Agent has its own settings for interfacing with AI providers, and other configuration options. These settings can be set and modified through the web interface.
