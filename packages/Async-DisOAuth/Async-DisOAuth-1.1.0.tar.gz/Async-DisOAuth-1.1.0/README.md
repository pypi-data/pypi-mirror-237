# DiscordOAuth2
automatically follows through with the requests for Discord OAuth

***

## Features
- Makes a Authorization Url automatically, using the client ID, redirect_uri, and the scopes you want
- Nothing else, working on getting the json data from the query string

***

## What I'm working on for version 1.0.0

- [x] Guaranteed features
  - [x] Make requests to each of the links for users(with exceptions, if it requires the building of any other class)
    - [x] Make a working api class (api meaning discord api)
      - [x] Make requests to the user api links
    - [x] return the json as a python dictionary
