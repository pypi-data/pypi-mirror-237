= PPH: Python Project Helper

PPH (Python Project Helper) is a tool designed to help develop Python software projects.

It is intended to be similar to https://python-poetry.org/[Poetry] or https://hatch.pypa.io/[Hatch], in that it helps you do things like create isolated virtual environments for your project. However, it is _unlike_ Poetry or Hatch in that it does not implement its own https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/[PEP 517] build backend. Instead, PPH works with _any_ build backend, using existing tools to build packages using the standard PEP 517 interface.

It is therefore also intended to be similar to https://pipenv.pypa.io/[Pipenv], being primarily a wrapper around existing tools. However, it is _unlike_ Pipenv in that Pipenv is explicitly only designed to support the case of building an "application" and not a "library". Instead, PPH makes no assumptions about the purpose or structure of your project.

The PPH command-line and `pyproject.toml` interfaces are loosely inspired by Hatch, but I make no claim or attempt at direct compatibility.

|===

I am deeply grateful to the many developers working hard on the Python packaging ecosystem, and I mean no disrespect or negativity towards other projects. I built this tool to meet my own needs, but I hope it will be useful to other people.

Contributions are welcome, but I am doing this in my spare time and I can't guarantee rapid movement on anything.

**WARNING**: PPH is _alpha-quality_ software under active development. The CLI and its output formats are subject to change. Not currently suitable for scripting.


== Installation

https://pypa.github.io/pipx/[Pipx] is recommended for installing PPH for general-purpose use. However it may also be installed using Pip or any other PyPI-compatible package manager (such as PDM).

In the future, I hope to package PPH for package managers such as Homebrew, Macports, Arch Linux, Debian, etc.

.Installation
[,shell]
----
# Install into the current environment:
pip install python-project-helper

# Install into an isolated environment with Pipx:
pipx install python-project-helper

== Usage

.Usage outline
[,shell]
----
pph

pph project
pph project inspect

pph env
pph env create {name}
pph env delete {name}
----

Virtual environments are created inside `+$XDG_STATE_HOME/python-project-helper/`. The format inside this directory is subject to change; do not depend on it for now.
