# clrflow
##### a lifesaver for python developers

clrflow is a color module for python like there never before was
- preset colors
- foreground and background options for every color function
- other text formatting options like bold, italic, underline, etc.
- the ability to use custom rgb values for colors
- duocolor gradient-applying aswell as multicolor pattern-applying functions (vertical, horizontal, foreground, background, ...)
- space saving, predefined printing functions including text alignment, loading/progress bars, realistic/slow typing, printing to specific lines and columns, ...
- more incoming

## Features

- create duocolored gradients with custom rgb values and automatic fade detection, layer, direction, ...
- create multicolored gradient patterns (with same options as above) with live editable configurations without having to create a new pattern
- make monocolored/formatted strings with, like above, custom rgb values and layers
- align text (also colored) within the terminal horizontally to the left,center or right, and vertically to the top,center or bottom, aswell as sub-horizontally to the left, center or right
- create fully customizable loading/progress bars
- print text to specific coordinates in the terminal
- print text like its handwritten or character by character

Many more predefined features will be added in the future.

## Platforms

It is yet unknown, but clrflow most likely only works on Windows. With feedback it should become universal in the future.

## Installation

This hasn't been tested yet, but clrflow runs best on Python 3.x, specifically 3.10.4, in which it was originally written and tested.

```sh
pip install clrflow
```

## License

Clrflow was originally planned to be unmodifiable (obfuscated), but by doing so others wouldn't be able to help me with my own code.
Therefore clrflows license is the **MIT** license.
