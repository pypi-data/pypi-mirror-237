## Installation

You can install `pit-viper` using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pit-viper
```

## Usage

### Environment Variables

The `pit-viper` package provides the `auto_env` function that loads environment
variables from a `.env` file. The function returns a `dict` of all existing
environment variables.

```python
from pit import viper

env = viper.auto_env()
```

## Development

We use [Poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) for packaging and
dependency management.
After installing Poetry, consider running the command below to configure Poetry
to create virtual environments in a folder named `.venv` within the project's
root directory.

```bash
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
```

Afterward, you can run the `install` command to install the dependencies
(including development requirements) specified in the `pyproject.toml` or
`poetry.lock` file.

```bash
poetry install
```

For a more comprehensive description of the Poetry setup and commands, see
their [documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs).
