*PyMsOfa* is a `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_ module for accessing `International Astronomical Union <http://www.iau.org/>`_'s `SOFA library <http://www.iausofa.org/>`_ from Python. SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) is a set of algorithms and procedures that implement standard models used in fundamental astronomy.

*PyMsOfa* is not a part of SOFA routines but a Python package for the SOFA C library. Thus, no calculations are made into the PyMsOfa package based on ctypes and cffi interface, which are all delegated to the underlying SOFA C library.

*PyMsOfa* is neither distributed, supported nor endorsed by the International Astronomical Union. In addition to *PyMsOfa*’s license, any use of this module should comply with `SOFA’s license and terms of use <http://www.iausofa.org/tandc.html>`_. Especially, but not exclusively, any published work or commercial products including results achieved by using *PyMsOfa* shall acknowledge that the SOFA software was used to obtain those results.
