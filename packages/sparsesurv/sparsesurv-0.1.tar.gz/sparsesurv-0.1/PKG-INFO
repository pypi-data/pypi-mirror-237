# sparsesurv
`sparsesurv` [1] is a toolbox for high-dimensional survival analysis. Currently, the package is focused exclusively on knowledge distillation for sparse survival analysis, sometimes also called preconditoning [2, 3]. In the future, we plan to also extend `sparsesurv` to other techniques useful for (high-dimensional) survival analysis that are not commonly available in Python.

## Installation
The easiest way to install `sparsesurv` is currently via PyPi:

```
pip install sparsesurv
```

If you want to install directly from Github, you can also install by cloning the repo, or directly piping the repo to pip:

```
git clone https://github.com/BoevaLab/sparsesurv/
cd sparsesurv
pip install .
```

```
pip install git+https://github.com/BoevaLab/sparsesurv.git
```

If there is sufficient interest, we may also provide a conda package in the future.
