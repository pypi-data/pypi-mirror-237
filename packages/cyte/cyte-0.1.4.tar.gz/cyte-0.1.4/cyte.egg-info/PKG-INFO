May you metaphorically recognize this as:

A reservoir of pure
[ 	
	[ 2, "HYDROGEN" ], 
	[ 1, "OXYGEN" ]
]
molecules.

Where, you discovered it in a 
place where you have
undisputable claim to the 
entire span of every dimension 
(including time).

However, this pure water, may only
be used to promote veganism.
