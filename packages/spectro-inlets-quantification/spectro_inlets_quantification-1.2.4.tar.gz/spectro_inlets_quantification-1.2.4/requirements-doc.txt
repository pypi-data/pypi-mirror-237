# We depend on an unreleased feature of sphinx-proof for building the docs. Installing directly
# from source code with pip is not supported on ReadTheDocs, so we have to make this trick. We
# put all other doc deps are in requirements-rtd.txt, which is installed with pip on RTD, and
# then we add that and the source dep in requirements-doc.txt, which is what is installed in
# virtual environments for local development. The source dependency is then installed manually on
# RTD
-r requirements-rtd.txt
