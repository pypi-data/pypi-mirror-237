### Getting Started

GraphifyPy is a library meant for constructing graphs made using user-defined nodes/vertices and edges connecting these nodes/vertices, using Python. Alternatively, this library currently has the functionality to generate 3 special types of graphs based on user-defined sizes- Complete, Bipartite and Cycle graphs. 

The UndirectedGraph() class is to be called for the purposes of a user-defined graph.
