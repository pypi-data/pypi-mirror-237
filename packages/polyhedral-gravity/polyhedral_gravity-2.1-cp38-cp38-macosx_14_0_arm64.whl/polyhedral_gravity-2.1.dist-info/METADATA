        The package polyhedral_gravity provides a simple to use interface for the evaluation of the full gravity
        tensor of a constant density polyhedron at given computation points. It is based on a fast, parallelized
        backbone in C++ capable of evaluating the gravity at thousands of computation points in the fraction of a second.
