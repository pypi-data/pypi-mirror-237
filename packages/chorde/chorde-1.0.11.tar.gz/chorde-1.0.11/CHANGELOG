# Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented here.

## [1.0.11] - 2023-10-27
### Bugfixes
- Fix reraising of tornado.web.HTTPError from inside async
  futures. Tornado exceptions don't behave as other exceptions
  and need special treatment

## [1.0.10] - 2023-08-29
### Bugfixes
- Fix an instance of overallocation that could turn into a DoS
  where we could be allocating arbitrarily large byte arrays.
  This was affecting mostly the coherence protocol in some
  exceptional circumstances.
- Make ``Future.add_done_callback`` work properly from inside
  an asyncio event loop.
- Restrict cython to below 3.x (can't build with Cython 3 yet)

## [1.0.9] - 2023-07-20
### Added
- Fix Future's await implementation to be compatible with asyncio

## [1.0.8] - 2023-07-12
### Added
- chorde.client.asyncache.Future is now awaitable

## [1.0.7] - 2023-06-29
### Bugfixes
- Prevent memory leaks by clearing non-running traceback
  frames from exceptions set as future results.

## [1.0.6] - 2023-06-27
### Bugfixes
- Allow sPickle unpicklers to accept strings as checksum keys

## [1.0.5] - 2023-06-27
### Bugfixes
- Allow sPickle to accept strings as checksum keys, automatically
  encode them as UTF8 to get byte keys, as most people would expect
  string keys to work.

## [1.0.4] - 2023-05-15
### Bugfixes
- Fix empty reason field when re-raising tornado.web.HTTPError

## [1.0.3] - 2023-04-21
### Bugfixes
- Various string encoding fixes

## [1.0.0] - 2023-03-02
### Removed
- Dropped Python 2.x support

### Added
- Added Python 3.6+ support

### Changes
- Renamed fn.async() decorator call into fn.bg() to make it
  Python 3 compatible
- Renamed clients.async module to clients.asyncache
  (to make it Python 3 compatible)
- Key/value picklers now **must** return bytes
- Key/value picklers are now strategy instances instead
  of namespaces. Check the new interface when migrating
  code that passes custom picklers. New picklers must implement
  the appropriate BasePickler subclass.
- Futures no longer strip exception tracebacks by default.
  This follows Python 3's new traceback handling behavior,
  but it may cause additional memory leaks due to the way
  tracebacks hold references to frames and all local variables.
  It is recommended that stripping is re-enabled for production
  code using `chorde.clients.asyncache.set_strip_tracebacks(True)`.

## [0.9.0] - Unreleased
### Removed
- Lock pools and deadlock detection from chorde.serialize have
  been removed (no longer used)

### Bugfixes
- Fixed high latency (50ms) of missing `async()()` calls
- Fix alternative slot search in SharedCounter when the autoselected
  slot is occupied.

## [0.8.4] - 2021-09-29
### Bugfixes
- Apply TTL namespace variation on all code paths.
  Some were neglected.

## [0.8.3] - 2021-09-29
### Changes
- Consider TTL when computing automatic namespaces to avoid
  mixing differently-configured entries, which can cause
  TTL failures

## [0.8.2] - 2021-04-08
### Bugfixes
- Automatically clean broken entries from files caches,
  otherwise they can be left there indefinitely and prevent
  correct cache operation

## [0.8.1] - 2021-03-25
### Improvements
- Reduced stats tracking overhead when using Cython
- Optimize code generation for the native platform by default

## [0.8.0] - 2020-11-19
### Changes
- Use cLRU cuckoocache and lrucache

### Improvements
- Overrideable minimum and dynamic TTLs in dnsutils dynamic
  resolving client.

## [0.7.4] - 2020-05-15
### Bugfixes
- Add missing include file to MANIFEST.in

## [0.7.3] - 2020-05-15
### Bugfixes
- Add MANIFEST.in to also include pxd files and others

## [0.7.2] - 2020-05-15
### Bugfixes
- Fix setup.py to include requirements.txt in the source build

## [0.7.1] - 2020-05-15
### Bugfixes
- Fix future().peek reporting of late (async) misses
- Fix MemcachedStoreClient.set_multi when sockets become broken.
  It would error out trying to unregister them from the poller.
- Make tempfile cleanup in FilesCacheClient more robust
- Fix ThreadPool.join's return value in some cases with multiple
  joiners
- Fix ElastiCacheClient to force-refresh its DNS endpoint even
  when it points to a single server. EC should always be dynamic.

## [0.7.0] - 2019-07-11
### Improvements
- Optimized threadpool implementation to lower queuing latency
  and overall overhead. Simplified things considerably by
  avoiding zero-copy slicing, something that's hard to get
  right and actually incurred a significant latency penalty.
  List slicing is quite fast anyway.

## [0.6.0] - 2019-04-04
### Added
- Added strict_no_servers option to memcache clients. If passed,
  it will raise NoServersError when no server can be reached,
  instead of treating the condition as a miss.

## [0.5.4] - 2018-09-24
### Bugfixes
- Fix threadpool.join's return value

## [0.5.3] - 2018-08-23
### Bugfixes
- Fixed placeholder functionality on async() calls
- Fix PyPy compatibility

### Changed
- CacheMissError is now a proper alias of KeyError rather
  than a subclass. Keeping it as a subclass was cumbersome.

## [0.5.2] - 2018-08-01
### Improvements
- Reduced GC pressure by cleaning up callback list on done
  futures immediately after popping the callbacks for
  execution. This breaks cycles and allows freeing objects
  through RC instead of GC, especially since callbacks tend
  to be closures referencing a lot of application state.

## [0.5.1] - 2018-07-26
### Bugfixes
- Fixed packaging of pxd files

## [0.5.0] - 2018-07-12
### Added
- Added setdefault and get to exported cython methods
  in cuckoocache.pxd so external modules can optimally
  interact with it using its dict interface

### Improvements
- Improved async latency by executing cleanup tasks
  after notifying the results, rather than before.

### Bugfixes
- Fixed bug in clients.Base.get that could cause clients that
  used the base implementation to return stale results when
  invoked with a custom default.
- Fixed coherence OOB updates, which in some circumstances
  could renew a stale value instead of fetch a fresh shared
  one.
- Fix assorted thread safety issues in the lockless Threadpool
  implementation

## [0.4.2] - 2018-06-14
### Changed
- Compatibility with Cython 0.28
- Cythonized decorators and some base clients to lower caching
  overhead in the most commonly used patterns
  NOTE: cythonized decorators aren't picklable, so client code
  may have to be adapted to not depend on the picklability of
  decorated functions

### Improvements
- Small performance improvements
- Prevent busy looping in async waitkey in some corner cases

## [0.4.1] - 2018-03-08
### Bugfixes
- Throttle coherence tics when trying to refresh stale pending
  entries in the broker. Under some conditions (forgotten
  tasks and very high timeouts), a very high rate of tic
  requests could be generated, causing channel overload.

### Changed
- Added some useful debug logging to chorde.mq.coherence

## [0.4.0] - 2018-02-19
### Added
- Add expire() calling mode to decorated functions to perform
  an expire on the relevant key.

### Bugfixes
- Fix combined use of coherence and renew_ttl. Renew
  would take precedence over the refresh operation,
  perpetuating stale results

## [0.3.1] - 2018-02-07
### Bugfixes
- Fix broker state listener states on some corner-case
  error handling in coherence manager that might cause it
  to have both listener and broker event listeners registered
  with the ipsub channel

## [0.3.0] - 2017-12-06
### Bugfixes
- Fix NamespaceMirrorWrapper.clear by properly proxying
  writes on revision and revmark_ttl
- Make LazyCuckooCache's rehash (resize) operation
  atomic to avoid concurrent rehashing, which can cause
  corruption and crashes in rare corner cases, most
  notably with non-preallocated caches that grow very
  rapidly from concurrent writer threads and cause
  eviction callbacks due to hash collisions during
  rehashing.

### Changed
- Each client has a different logger

## [0.2.1] - 2017-10-12
### Bugfixes
- Fix TieredInclusiveClient's handling of REGET during
  coherence. In cases where high load might make the
  L1 expiration be missed by the time putnext gets
  the REGET reply, the way REGET was implemented might
  step on fresh values of the cache with old ones
  inadvertantly. Check the values' TTL befure using it
  in a REGET, inhibit caller's reget, and use promotion
  logic instead.

## [0.2.0] - 2017-09-20
### Changed
- Made ttl_skip not return default/CacheMissError when the
  only available value is below the skip threshold. Instead,
  return the available item as does TieredInclusiveCache.
  The logic works better with lazy decorators and async
  refresh in this way, and is more uniform across clients.
- FastMemcachedClient: Refresh DNS in the bgwriter thread
  to avoid latency spikes caused by DNS queries

### Added
- Support for getMulti and getTtlMulti to all clients,
  with optimized versions for memcached
- An option tcp_nodelay to MemcachedStoreClient to reduce
  latency in latency-sensitive applications
- Add a LazyCuckooCache implementing a lazy form of
  cuckoo hashing (ie: without relocation) to implement a
  quasi-LRU eviction strategy with O(1) reads and updates

## [0.1.0]
