05/11/2010 (Q.Z.) seg1 output energy is lower due to the reduction of beta08
voltage, so the distribution of charge states were changed based on Baron formula,
and other parameters are used the same as 79+.

The default thickness variation is +/-5%, but should try use +/-10% as ANL using
Change the 2nd entry of the 5th line for the thickness variation 
Note: updated on 04/03/08 as agreed at ASF mtg (DG,FM,MD,XW,QZ, east room PM)
This version only generates five charge states, 08/29/2008 (Q.Z.)
